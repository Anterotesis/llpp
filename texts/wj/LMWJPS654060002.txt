To the Worshipfull Sr. John Gonson Knight & the rest of his Majesties Justices of the Peace at the General Quarter Sessions of the Peace now held for the City & Liberty of Westmr. in the County of Middx

The humble Petition of Charles William Stutley

Humble Sheweth That yr. Petr. by Indenture of Apprentiship bearing Date the Twenty sixth Day of November 1733. was bound Apprentice to Jerrom Johnson of the Parish of St. [...] Martin in the Fields in the County of Middx Glas Ingraver for the Term of Seven Years from thence next ensuing to learn the Art of Glass Ingraving. And tho' ye Petr. hath faithfully sewed his [...] Master the sd. Jerrom Johnson ever since Yet his sd. Master hath not instructed him in the sd. Art, but (as ye Petr. verily believes) to conceal the same from yr. Petr. put what work of that kind he has for two Years past had to do, to be wrought by another Person & has imployed Yr. Petr. only to scollop Glass (an Art which his sd, Master did not follow before nor at the time ye. Petr. was bound to him as aforesd.) which has been very prejudicial to yr. Petrs. Health whereby yr. Petr. has been twice poisoned & is now so weak That he is unable to work at any Business & is afraid he shall never recover his Health again.

Yr. Petr. therefore humbly prays that his sd. Master may be compelled to teach & instruct him in the sd. Art of a Glass Ingraver as by his [---] Indre he is obliged to do, or that yr. Petr. may be discharged from his sd. Indre of Apprenticeship or have such further & other Relief as to yr. Worships shall seem meet

And yr. Petr. shall ever pray Etc

Charles Wm Stutley
