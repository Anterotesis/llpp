To Sir John Gonson, Knt

The Humble Petition of Mary Fedden

Sheweth That your Petitioner was yesterday found guilty of an Indictment for keeping a disorderly House in Eagle Court in ye Strand, that as your Petitioners Conviction appeared to be intirely owing to ye Spitelfield Evidence of Some Lodgers of your Petitioners and some Neighbours your Petitioner had ye Misfortune to have differ'd with during the time she kept the Said House, that your Petitioner had nothing charged upon her but by hear say

Therefore humbly hopes that your Honour will be pleased, according to your wanted Goodness, and as a Congernation of the good Opinion the World has so justly harbour'd of your Justice and Impartiality recommend your Petitioner to ye Honourable Bench and prays that your Endeavours may not be wanting to mitigate her Punishment in Proportion to the Weakness of ye Evidence, your Petitioner having never been privy to any De Orders, charg'd to have been Committed in her said House

And as In Duty bound your Petitioner Shall ever Pray Etc
