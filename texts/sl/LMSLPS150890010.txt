The Humble Petition of the several Importers of Rape Seed within the City of London and the Liberties thereof

Sheweth That for some time past the common Market Price of middling British Rape Seed at the new Corn Market in Mark Lare hath exceeded the Sum of seventeen Pounds and ten Shillings per Last the Continuance whereof your Petitioners apprehend will prove very Detrimental to the City in General and to your Petitioners in particular

That your Petitioners are ready to make the Truth hereof appear and to prove the same in such manner as by the Statutes in that behalf is required

Your Petitioners therefore most humbly pray that this Honourable Court will take their Case into consideration and proceed to examine and determine the common Market Price of middling British Rape Seed as the same is now and has been lately brought and sold in the Markets of this City and to certify the same to his Majesty's Chief Officer and Collector of the Customs in such manner as by the Statutes in their behalf as required and directed.

And your Petitioners shall ever pray Etc.
