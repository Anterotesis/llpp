To the Right Honourable John Wilkes Esqr Lord Mayor of the City of London and the rest of his Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the said City at the General Quarter Sessions assembled.

The humble Petition of the Fellowship of Carmen London.

Sheweth. That your Petitioners humbly and thankfully beg leave to represent to your Lordship and Worships that in the Year 1772 having presented a Petition to this Honourable Court setting forth "That the Expence of Horsekeeping had for sometime past been greater than "at any former period-that the Price of Horses and of every other Article "in their Business (as well as of the necessarries of Life) was greatly "advanced since making of the Rates for Cartage in 1757-that your "Petitioners being likewise deprived of near one third part of the Labour "they enjoyed at the time by Unlicensed Carts were much hurt in their "Circumstance by the concurrence of the said Causes"-This Honble. Court was pleased to grant them such relief by an Augmentation of the Rates of Cartage as savid many of their Families from utter ruin.

That at the adjournment of the July session in 1774 the Expence of Horse keeping only being reduced this Augmentation was taken off and the Rates reduced to the Old Standard as in 1757.

That as all the other hardships mentioned in the Felowships former Petition (above recited) as the joint Causes of their former application to this Court do now and have ever since subsisted in their full extent-As the expence of Horse keeping is again much advanced and both Hay and Corn continue to rise daily. Your Petitioners finding by experience that their present Burthen is as great or greater than they can well support, and being alarmed at the prospect of that ruin in which many of their Familes will be involved if the Price of these essential Articles should continue to advance without an adeguate increase in the Rates of Cartage are constrained to avail themselves of the only opportunity they have

have of laying their Case before this Honourable Court at this present Session and of humbly requesting

Your Lordship & Worships to grant them such relief in the Premises as to your Lordship and Worships shall seem meet

And Your Petitioners shall ever pray Etc
