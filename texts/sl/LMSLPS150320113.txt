To the Rt Honble Sr John Fryer Barrt Lord Mayor of the City of London, & the rest of his Majtys: Justices of the Peace at their General Quarter Sessions of the Peace held in & for the said City Assembled.

The humble Peticon & Appeal of the Master Wardens Assistants & Fellowship of the Company of Glovers of the City of London

Sheweth That your Petrs rent only a small part of a certain messuage or Tenement Situate in Beech Lane in the Parish of St Giles without Cripplegate in the Freedom of the said City at the yearly rent of £20

That your Petitioners let part of what they so rent to one Thomas Jeffrys who is rated for the same to the Poors Rate of the sd Parish at 10s P Annm, So that your Petrs Rent is but barely £10 P Ann for what remains in their Occupation.

That notwithstanding the premisses your Petrs are this present year Assessed and rated by the Church wardens. & Overseers of the said Parish towards Relief of their Poor the Sume of £1:10s:0d which is much more in proportion them others are rated in the said Assessment.

That not only your Pet but several other Occupiers of Houses are over rated, several Substantial Inhitants & Occupiers are under rated, & Dr Bennett the present Vicar, & Several others of the Said Parish are wholly omitted to be rated at all, or even their Names incerted in the Poors Books, and no Inhabitants are therein rated for their Personal Estates, whereby (as your Petrs apprehend) the sd Rate is very unequall & oppressive and (as your Petrs are advised) the same is illegall, and from which they appeal

Wherefore yor Petrs most humbly pray That the said Rate may be Quashed Or that they may be otherwise relieved in the premisses at this Honble Court Shall think fit

And yor Petrs shall ever pray Etc
