The Humble Petition of the several Consumers of Wheat and Pease within the City of London and the Liberties thereof

Your Petitioners therefore most humbly pray that this Honble, Court will take their Case into consideration, and proceed to examine and determine the Common Market Prices of middling British Wheat and middling British Pease as the same are now and have been lately bought and sold in the Markets of this City, and to certify the same to his Majesty's Chief Officer and Collector of the Customs in such manner as by the Statutes in this behalf is required and directed
