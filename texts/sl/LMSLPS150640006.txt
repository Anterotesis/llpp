Sessions Papers 1753 To the Right Honourable Sir Crisp Gascoigne Knight Lord Mayor of the City of London, and the Aldermen of the same City.

The humble Petition of the several Journeymen Taylor and Staymakers within the said City.

Humbly Sheweth That your Petitioners preferred their Petition at the General Quarter Sessions of the Peace held at Guildhall in and for the said City of London in October 1751 Before the then Right Honourable Francis Cokayne Esquire then Lord Mayor of the said City and the Aldermen of the same City Setting forth That by an Act of Parliament made in the Seventh year of the Reign of King George the first for regulating the Journeymen Taylor within the Weekly Bills of Mortality It is amongst other things Enacted that the hours of Work for all Journeyman Taylor Servants and Apprentices to Taylors and other Person employed or to be employed or [...] in making up Mens or Womens Cloaths or such Servant or Apprentices within the Cities of London and Westminster or either of than or within the Weekly Bills of Mortality shall be from Six of the Clock in the Morning untill Eight of the Clock at Night Excepting only that there shall be Allowed by the Master one penny half penny for Breakfast and one from for Dinner in the time aforesaid And for the said time or hours aforesaid there shall be paid into every Journeyman Taylor or other Person Employed or to be employed or retained as a Journeyman Taylor for his Work during he Hours aforesaid the Wages and Sums following (that is to say) from the 25th. day of March to the 24th. day of June any Sum or Sums not exceeding two Shillings a day, and for the rest of the Year One Shilling and eight pence a day.

That the Legislature then perceiving it would be reasonable and necessary upon some Occasions thereafter to Alter the Wages and hours of Work aforesaid It is thereby further Enacted that it shall and may be lawfull to and for the Justices of the peace in their respective Jurisdictions within the Limits aforesaid at their General Quarter Sessions And they are thereby authorized and required upon Application to be made to them for that purpose to take into their Consideration the Plenty or Scarcity of the time and other Circumstances necessary to be considered And to Alter the Wages and hours of Work aforesiad And to Order and Appoint which Wages and allowances shall be paid or made to Journeymen Taylors and Servants retained or employed in the Art or Mistery of Taylor aforesaid within the Limits aforesaid And what hours they shall Work, and shall make such Allerations therein from time to time as such Justices at any such General Sessions shall think fit upon Application to be made to them for that purpose And such Justices shall within the space of Fourteen Days next after such General Sessions Came such Rates and Atterations from time to time to be Printed Published and made known in such manner as to them shall seem meet at the reasonable Expence of any Person or Persons Desiring the Same And from and after Publication thereof all Taylors and their Journeymen and Servants within the Limits aforesaid are thereby stricktly required to observe the Same upon pain of Imprisonment by such Justices for any time not exceeding two Months being lawfully Convicted of such Offence after knowledge and Information of any such Rates or Alterations thereof to be made as aforesaid upon any Prosecution to be Commenced within Six days after the Offence Committed.

That since the making the above Act the Price of Labour in all Trades and Businesses is much increased of which the Master Taylors are so Sensible that the greatest part and most Eminent amongst them have for several Years past paid their Journeymen 2s.6d. a day all the year.

That your Petitioners were untill the late Disputes between the Masters and their Journeymen in Middlesex intirely Ignorant of the said Act and the Penalties incurred by paying and receiving more Wages than by the said Act is allowed for want of having an Order and Appointment made for the payment of the Same by your Worships in pursuance of the Power vested in you by the said Act.

That your Petitioners therefore their humbly prayed that your Worships would be pleased to alter the Wages and the hours of working mentioned in the Said Act and to Order that the Master Taylors residing in the said City should pay unto every Journeyman Taylor for his Work 2s.6d. a day And that the hours of Working be appointed to be from Six of the Clock in the Morning to Six of the Clock at Night Or that your Worships would be pleased to make such other Order in the Premisses as to your Worships should seem

to That

That on hearing the said Petition on Argument by Councel as well on the part of your Petitioners as of the Master Taylors the Court was pleased to Order The Master Taylors to pay to every Journeyman Taylor for his Work 2s. 6d. a day from Lady day to Midsummer and 2s. a day for the Remainder of the year besides the usual Allowance made by the said Act for Breakfast And to Order the hours of Working to be from Six of the Clock in the Morning to Seven of the Clock at Night, And that the said Order should be in force for one whole Year

That the said Order expired in October last And on your Petitioners not applying then to your Worships for another Order several of the master Taylors and Staymakers have ever since taken an Advantage thereof and depay no more than 20d. a day to their Journeymen and do also force them to Work the old hours appointed by the said recited Act. Which is very oppressive Juregard that the hours of Work in all or most other Handicraft Trades (especially those Depending on the Eye sight) are from Six in the Morning till Six at Night, But your Petitioners hours or Work by the said Act exceed that time by two hours, and in the Winter time above Six hours by Candlelight and often on Bla [...] Work and also on Gold and Silver Holes, which very much strains the Strongest Eyes, and by Sitting so many hours in such a Position almost double on the Shop Board with their Legsunder them, and poring so long ever their Work by Candle light their Spirits are exhansted nature is wearied out, and their Heath and Sight are soon impaired, Insomuch that many in the prime of their Years are become Despised by their Mastors, by reason their Sight is decayed and they cannot See to workas well as others, Which is occasioned by their Sitting in such a Position, and working solong by Candle light as is done by them, and by no other Trade whatever that requires the Eye sight so much as the poor Journey men do, And when so we aried out in order to get Bread for themselves and Families the poor miserable Wretches are obliged to work for Masters at an under price, And as there is a great uncertainty of Work, a poor Journeyman often changes his Master, and frequently has a Mile or a Mile and a half or more to go to Work therefore must rise at Five in the Morning to be at his Work by Six, And at Night cannot get home much before Nine, So that a poor married Man can have little Comfort with his Wife and Children.

That from Midsummer untill sometime after Michaelmas in every Year the Journeymen in general [...] little or no Work, and are not Employed in the whole above Thirty two Weeks in the Year, which at 2s:6d. a day doth not exceed one Week with another 9s. a Week.

Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that in Compassion to the several Hardships they Labour under Your Worships will be pleased to Atter the Wages and the hours of Working mentioned in the said Act And to Order that every Master Taylor and Staymaker residing in the said City of London do and shall pay unto every Journeyman for his Work two Shillings and Six pence a day And that the hours of Working for the future be appointed to be from Six of the Clock in the Morning to Six of the Clock at Night, Or that your Worships will be pleased to make such other Order or Appointment in the Premisses as to your Worships shall seem meet

And your Petitioners shall every pray Etc
