To the Right Honourable Brass Crosby Esquire Lord Mayor of the City of London and to the Worshipfull the Aldermen his Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the same City at their General Quarter Session of the Peace Assembled

The Humble Petition of the Fellowship of Carmen.

Sheweth That by an Order for regulating the Standings of the licensed Carts made in 1681 only forty Carts are allowed to stand in lower Thames Street Your Petitioners have been at sundry times summoned before the Magistrates of this City for Breaches of the said Regulation altho' the Business of the five Keys in (by the great Increase of the National Trade) so considerably augmented since that time as often to require and employ at least four times that Number.

That although by the conversion of many dwelling Houses on the south side of the said Street into Warehouses there is Room made for upwards of 80 Carts to stand yet at certain Seasons of the Year when there is a want of Business Your Petitioners can by no means present their empty Carts from incommoding the Inhabitants of the said Street at there are very few convenient Places contiguous to the same that are allowed for Stands by that Regulation

Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray this Honourable Court to take their Case into Consideration and to appoint such an additional Number of Stands for Carts in and adjoining to the said Street as may be necessary for the regular and orderly carrying on the Business of the said Street and Keys.

And your Petitioners shall ever pray Etc

George Spencer John Barnjum Wm Marden Wardens
