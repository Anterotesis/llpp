To the Right Honourable Sir Samuel Fludyer Knight & Baronet Lord Mayor of the City of London and to the worshipful the Aldermen his Majestys Justices of the Peace for the same City at their General Quarter Session of the Peace assembled

The humble Petition of the several Inn holders Stable Keepers and other Consumers of Oats, whose Names are hereunto subscribed, on behalf of themselves and all other Consumers of Oats in the City of London.

Sheweth That lately the common Markett Price of midling English Oats at the new Corn Markett in Mark Lane does exceed [---] the Sum of sixteen Shillings the Quarter, the Continuance whereof, your Petitioners apprehend, must prove very detrimental to the City in general and to your Petitioners in particular

That your Petitioners are ready to make the Truth hereof appear, and to prove the same in such manner as by the Statutes in that behalf is required

Wherefore your Petitioners most humbly pray that this Honourable Court will take their Case into Consideration and proceed to examine and determine the Common Market Price of midling English Oats as the same, now is and hath lately been bought and sold in the Marketts of this City, and to certify the same to his Majesty's Chief Officer and Collector of the Customs in such manner as by the Statutes in this behalf is required and directed.

And your Petitioners shall ever pray Etc.
