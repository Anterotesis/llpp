The Humble Petition of the Master Wardens and Society of Innholders of the City of London on behalf of themselves and all other the Consumers of Oats in the said City of London

Sheweth That lately the common Market Price of middling British Oats at the new Corn Market in Mark Lane has exceeded the Sum of sixteen Shillings the Quarter the Continuance whereof your Petitioners apprehend must prove very detrimental to the City in General and to your Petitioners in particular

That your Petitioners are ready to make the Truth hereof appear and to prove the same in such manner as by the Statutes in that behalf is required

Wherefore your Petitioners most humbly pray that this Honble Court will take their case into Consideration and proceed to examine and determine the common Market Price of middling British Oats as the same is now and hath been lately bought and sold in the Markets of this City and to certify the same to his Majesty's Chief Officer and Collector of the Customs in such manner as by the Statutes in this Behalf is required and directed.

And your Petitioners shall ever pray Etc.

Rob Holder Sol: for the Petitioners
