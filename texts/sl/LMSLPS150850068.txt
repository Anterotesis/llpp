To the Right Honourable Frederick Bull Esquire Lord Mayor of the City of London and the rest of his Majesties Justices of the Peace for the said City at the General Quarter Sessions Assembled.

The humble Petition of Sundry Merchants and Traders of the City of London.

Sheweth That at a General Sessions of the Peace held by adjournment the Twenty sixth day of September one thousand seven hundred and Seventy two in Pursuance of a Petition of the Fellowship of Carmen of the said City alledging the then very high price of Provender this honourable Court was Pleased to make a new regulation and Assessment in the Prices of the Carriage of Goods and increase the rates and Cartage as in the said order is Particularly mentioned.

That in Pursuance of such order your Petitioners are charged and have ever since Paid an extra Price for the Cartage of all Goods which is nearly equal to one fifth more than the former Rates.

That the cause of the Carmens Complaint of the then very high Price of Provender for their Horses is now in a great measure removed Hay and Corn being abundently cheaper than when they applied and the Pavement in general now so good in most Parts of the Town that they may carry two Loads to most of the distances in near the same time they usually carried one before the amendment of the Pavement the wear and tear of their Carts consequently much less and far more easy for their Horses.

That the Petition for raising the Price of Cartage origmated with the Carmen, who are no more affected by the high Prices of Provender for their Horses than Persons who keep Hackney Coaches or Coal Carts the former of whom have had no addition to their Fares and the latter have for some time Past reduced their Rates to what they were before the last advance took Place.

That at the before mentioned Sessions when the rates of Cartage were raised it was understood the order then made was to have been in force for one Year and no longer unless the Provender for Horses continued at the then very high Price

That the Prices of Cartage have been raised at various times on divers Pretences and your Petitioners not being Apprised of the late Application of the Carmen had no opportunity of giving their reasons why even then an increase of the Rates ought not to have taken Place

That your Petitioners apprehend and humbly submit to this Honourable Court that the Rates formerly paid are an ample and sufficient compensation for the labour, and much more so than the Price of the Carriage of Coals which tho' generally drawn by three Horses is only Two shillings and ten Pence pre Chaldron from the waterside to all distances within the City wharfage and wear and tear of Sacks included.

Your Petitioners therefore most humbly Pray your Lordship and worships to take the Premises into Consideration and make a reduction in the rates or Price of Cartage in such manner as to your Lordships and Worships Shall seem meet

And your Petitioner shall ever Pray Etc.
