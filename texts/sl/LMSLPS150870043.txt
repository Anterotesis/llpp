To the Right Honourable John Sawbridge Esquire Lord Mayor of the City of London and the Worshipfull the Aldermen his Majestys Justices of the Peace for the same City at their General Quarter Sessions of the Peace assembled

The Humble Petition of the several Consumers of Oats and Pease within the City of London and the Liberties thereof.

Sheweth That for some time past the Common Market Prices of middling British Oats and middling British Pease at the new Corn Market in Mark Lane have exceeded the Sums following, to wit, middling British Oats the Sum of sixteen Shillings the Quarter, and middling British Pease the Sum of thirty two Shillings the Quarter, the continuance whereof your Petitioners apprehend will prove very detrimental to the City in General, and to your Petitioners in particular.

That your Petitioners are ready to make the Truth hereof appear, and to prove the same, in such manner as by the Statutes in that behalf is required

Your Petitioners therefore most humbly pray that this Honourable Court will take their Case into Consideration and proceed to examine and determine, the Common Market Prices of middling British Oats, and middling British Pease, as the same are now; and have been lately bought and sold in the Markets of this City, and to certify the same to his Majesty's Chief Officer and Collector of the Customs, in such manner, as by the Statutes in this behalf is required and directed.

And your Petitioners shall ever pray Etc.
