To the Right Honourable Barlow Trecothick Esquire Lord Mayor of the City of London and to the Worshipfull the Aldermen his Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the same City at their General Quarter Session of the peace assembled.

The Humble Petition of the Master Wardens and Society of Innholders of the City of London on behalf of themselves and the rest of the Consumers of Oats within the said City and the Liberties thereof

Sheweth That for some time past the Common market price of Midling English Oats at the new Corn Market in Mark Lane has exceeded the sum of Sixteen Shillings the Quarter the Continuance whereof your Petitioners apprehend must prove very detrimental to the City of London in general and to your Petitioners in particular

That your Petitioners are ready to make the truth hereof appear and to prove the same in such manner as by the Statutes in that behalf is required

Your Petitioners therefore most humbly pray that this Honourable Court will take their cause into Consideration, and proceed to examine and determine the Common Market price of midling English Oats as the same is now and hath been lately bought and sold in the Markets of this City and to Certify the same to his Majesty's Chief Officer and Collector of the Customs in such Manner as by the Statutes in this behalf is required and directed

And your Petitioners shall ever pray Etc.
