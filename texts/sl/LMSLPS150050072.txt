April Sessions 1694 To the Right Honble Sr William Ashurst Knt Lord Maior of the City of London and to their Maties Justices of the Peace within the same City

The Humble Petition of the Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor of the Parish of St Botolph wth out Bishopsgate London

Sheweth That (the said Parish being large and full of Poor) this Honble Court many yeares since was pleased (according to the Forme of the Statute in that case made and provided) to order the Parishio -ners of divers Parishes within the sd City to contribute their Assistance towards the Releife of the said Poor wth Contribucon amounted to abt £60 P Ann & was continued till the contributing Parishes were burut by the dreadfull conflagracon in the yeare of our Lord 1666 and then ceased

That after the Rebuilding of the said City (the Rents thereof being greatly advanced) the meaner sort of people whose houses had been burst were thereby constrained to continue in the said Parish of St Botoloph Bippgate where they had settled themselves But many wealthy Inhitants of the same Parish (who by the said Fire were driven from their habitacons) retired back to their former places of Abode and great members of Poor have since resorted to the said Parish and there settled themselves in their stead By meanes whereof the Rich Inhitants of the sd Parish are greatley decreased and the Poor thereof become exceeding numerous

That this Honoble Court takeing into consideracon the Poverty of the said Parish and Pceiving that the Inhitants thereof were not able to maintaine their Poor wth out Assistance Did in ye year of o Lords 1687 Rate and Assess the Inhitants of divers Parishes within the sd City to pay to the Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor of the said Parish of St Botolph towards the maintenance of the Poor of the same Parish divers weekly Allowances amounting in the whole to £30 P Ann

That notwithstanding the sd Allowances ye Peticoners (for the better maintenance of the Poor) have been constrained to advance the Rates on the sd Inhitants of there sd Parish soe excessively That divers eminent Parishioners have removed into other Parishes wehre smaller Taxes are exacted and more threaten to doe the like soe that the expedients your Peticoners have hitherto used to maintaine the Poor have proved ineffectuall

That allthough great members of the Inhitants of the said Parish are Weavers and such as depend on the weaving and such like mechanick Trades yett many of them till of late have paid towards the maintenance of the Poor and others have maintained themselves and Familyes without being burthen some to the said Parish But now soe it is May it please yor Lordshipp and Worshipps That by the deadness of Trade and for want of Imploym many of them have been forced to enter themselves into their Maties Service and have left their Familyes to be provided for by go Peticoners soe that the number of the Poor wthin the said parish is soe exceedingly increased That without some greater Assistance from Parishes within the said City the burthen thereof can noe longer be supported

May it therefore please yor Lordshipp and Worrps to take into your consideracons the deploreable necessities of the Poor of the said Parish and to order some Parishes within the said City to make such further Allowance and Contribution towards their Releife as to yor Honnor and Worrps shall seem next and convenient

And yor Peticoners shall ever pray Etc
