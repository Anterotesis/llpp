To the Rt Honble Sr John Fryer Barrt Lord Mayor of the City of London, & the rest of his Majtys: Justices of the Peace at their General Quarter Sessions of the Peace held in and for the said City Assembled.

The humble Peticon & Appeal of the Master Wardens Assistants & Fellowship of the Company of Glovers of the City of London

Sheweth That your Petrs rent only a small part of a certain messuage or Tenemt Scituate in Beech Lane in the Parish of St Giles without Cripplegate in the Freedom of the said City at the yearly Rent of £20.

That your Petrs let part of what they so rent to one Thomas Jeffries who is rated for the same to the Poors Rate of the said Parish at £10 P Annm, So that your Petrs rent is but barely £10 P Annm for what remains in their Occupation.

That notwithstanding the premisses your Petrs were in the year 1720 assessed and rated by the Churchwardens & Overseers of the said Parish towards relief of their Poor the Sum of £4:10s:0d part of which your Petrs have paid, which is much more in proportion than others are rated in the said Assessmts.

That Several Substantial Inhabitants & Occupiers of Houses within the said Parish are under rated to the said Rate or Assessments and several are wholly omitted to be rated therein at all, or even their Names incerted in the Book, and no Inhabitant is therein rated for his Personal Estate Whereby (as your Petrs are advised) the said Rate is illegall; at least your Petrs apprehend the same to be very unjust unequall and oppressive, and from which Rate or Assessmt they appeal

Wherefore your Petrs most humbly pray that the said Rates may be Quashed Or that they may be relieved in the premisses as this Honble Court shall think fit.

And yor. Petrs Shall ever pray Etc
