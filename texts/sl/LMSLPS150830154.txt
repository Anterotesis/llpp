To the Right Honourable William Nash Esqr Lord Mayor of the City of London and the rest of his Majesties Justices of the Peace for the sd. City at the General Quarter Sessions Assembled

The Humble Petition of the Wardens and Assistants of the Fellowship of Carmen London for and on the behalf of themselves and the rest of the Members of the said Fellowship.

Sheweth That your Petitioners beg leave to represent to your Lordship and Worships that the expence of Horse keeping has for a long time past been greater than at any former period and the Price of Horses and every other Article in their Business (as well as the necessaries of Life) is greatly advanced since the making of the last Rates for Cartage. Your Petitioners being likewise deprived of near one third part of the labour they enjoyed at that time by unlicensed Carts are by the concurrence of these Causes much hurt in their Circumstances within the course of these few last Years and are thereby constrained to apply to your Lordship and Worships for relief.

That as absolute necessity obliges your Petitioners to make this application so they beg leave at the same time to assure your Lordship & Worships that it is with great reluctance they now take this Step as they hoped to have been reestablished in their Ancient rights & Priviledges before the Commencement of this Sessions in which case the increase of Business would have some what alliviated their Burthen & enabled them to have waited in expectation that the Price of those necessary Articles which are accustomed to vary in their value would be reduced in the course of the succeding Year and thereby super side the necessity of a future application of this hind.

Your Petitioners therefore being thus necessitated to make this application & being restricted from doing it at any other Sessions that the Present Do humbly Pray Your Lordship & Worships to take this matter into your Consideration at this time & to grant them such an Augmentation of the present Rates of Cartage as may enable them to carry on their Business and support their Families.

And your Petitioners shall ever Pray Etc.
