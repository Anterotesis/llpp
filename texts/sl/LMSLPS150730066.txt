To the Right honourable Sir Samuel Fludyer Knt. & Bart. Lord Mayor of the City of London and to the Worshipful the Aldermen his Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the same City at their General Quarter Session of the Peace assembled.

The Humble Petition of the several Inn holders and Stable Keepers within the City of London on behalf of themselves and the other Consumers of Oats within the said City.

Sheweth That lately the common Market Price of midling English Oats at the new Corn Market in Mark Lane have exceeded the Sum of sixteen Shillings the Quarter the Continuance whereof your Petitioners apprehend must prove very detrimental to the City in general and to your Petitioners in Particular

That your Petitioners are ready to make the Truth thereof appear, and to prove the same in such manner as by the Statutes in that behalf is required.

Wherefore your Petitioners most humbly pray that this Honourable Court will take their Case into Consideration and proceed to examine and determine the Common Market Price of midling English Oats as the same is now and hath been lately bought and sold in the Marketts of this City and to certify the same to his Majesty's Chief Officer and Collector of the Customs in such manner as by the Statutes in this behalf is required and directed.

And your Petitioners shall ever pray Etc.
