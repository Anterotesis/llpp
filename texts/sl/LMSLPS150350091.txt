To the Rt: Honble: St: Peter Delme Knt: Lord Mayor of the Citty of London And to the Rt: Worpll: the Recorder and the rest of his Maties: Justices of the Peace for the Said Citty and the Liberties thereof at their General Quarter Sessions of the Peace holden for the Said Citty and Liberties at Guildhall London

The humble Peticon of the Church Wardens and overseers of the Poor of the Parish of St: Christopher le Stocks in the Send Citty for themselves and on behalf of the rest of the Inhabitants of the Said parish:

Sheweth That the Said Parish hath for many Years past and Still is Charged with the Payment of Six pounds P Ann towards the Releife of the Poor of the parish of St: Botolph Bishopsgate which they (the with great hardship) have hither to paid

But So now it is May it Please Yor: Lordship and Worps that the said Parish of St: Christopher is So much Advanced in the Poors Rate by the large Increase of their own Poor. That the Same Amounts to more than three times the Sume by them formerly paid

By means whereof the Said Parish notwithstanding the Great and on a Extraordinary Assessments on the Inhabitants thereof have been Obliged to a borrow at Interest large Sums of mony amounting to Several hundred pounds:

And altho the Said Parish (which conteins not more that Ninety houses, Several whereof are not Rested to the Poor) have Since Easter last made a Poors Rate for the current Service of this Year Amounting to more than Two hundred pounds Yet afterwards (upon a more Strict Enquiry into their affairs) did agree and Order (att another Vestry) an Addiconall Rate for Fifty pounds more which they fear will not be Sufficient to Subsiet their own Poor and defray their other necessary charges:

By reason whereof they humbly conceive themselves utterly unable longer to Contribute towards the Releife of the Said Poor of Bishopsgate parish without mainfest Incury and hardship to their own poor, and a very great Burthen and oppression on themselves.

Wherefore Yor: Petrs: most humbly begg Yor: Lord [...] and tvo [...] ps to take the premisses into yor: most Serious Consideracon And to Releive them therein, as to yor: Great Goodness and Justice Shall Seem meet

And as in Duty bound they shall ever Pray Ext.
