The Humble Petition of William Leeworthy a Prisoner in Newgate.

Sheweth That in March 1757 your Petitioner was apprehended on Pretence of being one William Lee who in 1753, as alledged, was transported for the Term of seven years, but on your Petitioners Examination before Justice Fielding and the Testimony of Several Persons of Credit, who know your Petitioner in North America in 1753 (Where he was born) and for some years there before the Sd. Justice discharged him.

That in June 1758 One Patrick Hanney a Commander of a Ship Caused your Petitioner to be apprehended in London, and Carried before Justice Fielding Instead of taking him before the Lord Mayor or Sitting Alderman when your Petitioner was Committed to Newgate by Justice Fielding

That a Bill of Indictment was last Session found against your Petitioner in Middlesex, And your Petitioner being then brought into Court was ready to take his Trial but the Prosecutor alledging the Bill ought to have been found in London your Petitioner was ordered to remain in Custody, altho' the Mistake (if it was one) was occasioned by the Irregularity of the Prosecutor and Hanney an forcibly dragging your Petitioner before a Justice for the County of Middlesex.

That your Petitioner hath reason to believe the said Patrick Hanney Spirits up this Prosecution with a View to get rid of your Petitioner's demand of Sixty Pounds [---] for Wages now due to him as Mate of the Ship

Your Petitioner therefore most humbly prays your Lordships that he may be Tried Bailed or discharged this present, Session for the pretended Offence

And your Petitioner will ever pray Etc
