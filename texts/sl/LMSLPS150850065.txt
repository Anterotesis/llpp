The Humble Petition of the Master Wardens and Society of Innholders London on behalf of themselves and all other the Consumers of Oats within the said City of London and the Liberties thereof

Sheweth That for some time past the common Market price of middling British Oats sold in the new Corn Market in Mark Lane hath exceeded the Sum of sixteen Shillings the Quarter the Continuance whereof your Petitioners apprehend will prove very detrimental to the City in General and to your Petitioners in particular

That your Petitioners are ready to make the the truth hereof appear and to prove the same in such manner as by the Statues in that behalf is required and directed

Your Petitioners therefore most humbly pray that this Honourable Court will take their Case into Consideration and proceed to examine and determine the common Market price of middling British Oats as the same is now and hath been lately bought and sold in the Markets of this City and to certify the same to his Majesty's Chief Officer and Collector of the Customs in such manner as by the Statutes in this behalf is required and directed

And your Petitioners shall ever pray Etca.
