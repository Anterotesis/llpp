Sheweth That your Petrs severally occupy small houses in the Parish of St. Giles without Cripplegate in the Freedom of the said City

That your Petrs were in the year 1720 assessed & rated by the Church wardens & Overseers of the said Parish towards Relief of their poor in several Considerable Sum vizt The said Mordeca Knight 1:19:0 - Wm Weeks 3:18:0 - Edwd Percival 1:12:0 - Edwd Ashworth 1:19:0 - Wm Hall - 1:19:0 - John House 1:19:0 James Sabin - 1:6: 0 - James Fawcett 1:6:0 - Ricd Marshall 1:12:6 William Folbigg 1:19:0 - Joseph Holmes - 2:12:0 - Thomas Hayens 1:19:0 - Matthew Trent 1:6:0 - John Richardson - 0:17:4 John Ash 1:19:0 - & John Munsie 1:19:0 - which is much more in proportion that their Neighbours in the sd Parish are rated in the said Assessmts

That not only your Peter but several other Occupiers of Houses are over-rated, Several Substantiall Inhabitants & Occupiers are under rated, and Several others of the said Parish are wholly omitted to be rated at all, or even their names incerted in the Poors books for the said Year; And no Inhabitants are therein rated for their Psonall Estate; whereby (as your Petrs are advised) & humbly apprehend the said rate is unequable oppressive and illegall; And from which Rates and Assessments they appeal.

Wherefore your Petitioners most humbly pray that the said Rates may be Quashed Or that they may be otherwise relieved in the premisses as this honble Court shall think fit.

And your Petrs shall ever pray Etc
