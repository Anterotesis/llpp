To the Right Honourable Thomas Wright Esquire Lord Mayor and the Worshipful the Aldermen and Recorder his Majestys Justices of the Peace for the City of London in the General Quarter Sessions of the Peace assembled

The humble Petition of the Wardens and Assistants of the Fellowship of Carmen London

Sheweth That your Petitioners have for a long time observed with concern how very much the Inhabitants resident in Lower Thomas Street and other Places in this City (where the Stands of Carts are appointed) are incommoded and put to very great Inconveniences by the continual Standing of Empty Carts not only thro' the day time; but much earlier in Summer than is allowed by the present Orders of Sessions

That the Inhabitants thereof have repeatedly with your Petitioners) endeavoured to remedy this very great Grievance both by Prosecutions, and otherwise without Effect

That your Petitioners conceive that a great part of the Inconvenience arives, by many of the Carmen carrying very large and unlawful Loads of certain Goods not particularly specified in the present Orders of Sessions, which if the same were properly divided it would occasion a greater succession and dispersion of the Carts from and off the different Stands

That your Petitioners in order to regulate and remedy this Grievance as far as in them lay have (at a Court of Assistants holden at Guildhall, of the said Wardens and Assistants on the 9th day of February 1769. after making the nicest and best Calculations they could, made certain Regulations and Ascertained what Quantity of Goods of different Sorts (not specefied in the Orders of Sessions) ought to be deemed and carried as a Load and Endeavoured to have the same observed by every Free Carman by dispersing One Thousand Printed Copies thereof amongst the whole Body of Carmen one of which said Copies is hereunto annexed.

That

That your Petitioners the more Effectually to compel an Observance of this Regulation have almost ever since kept a Beadle at 12s. P Week in addition to the Street Keepers to look after the Loading of Carts on the different Stands and to bring such as Offended against the Laws and Regulations by Summons either before a Court of the Fellowship or before some Magistrate of this City to be Punished, but the Court of Assistants having no Power n themselves and the Magistrate not having Jurisdiction to Punish as the Orders of Sessions now Stand without the weight of the Load being fully proved, your Petitioners humbly conceive that if the annexed Regulations were added to the present Orders the same would greatly relieve the said inhabitants would occasion a more equal Division of Work amongst the different Carmen without the least prejudice to the Merchants as your Petitioners are willing to prove to the Satisfaction of this Honourable Court

Your Petitioners also humbly conceive that the Hour of Six instead of Seven in the Winter, for the Carts to be on the Stand would not be too soon, and would serve both the Merchants and your Petitioners much better, and if this Honorable Court would please to increase the fine on a Breach of the 10th. Article of the present Orders to present the Carmen coming sooner that 4. in Summner and 6. in Winter on the Stands to 20s, or such greater Sum (than it now inflicts,) as this Honorable Court should in their Superior Judgment think fit, the same would greatly relieve the said Inhabitants, and would also be, more beneficial to your Petitioners and the free Carmen in General

Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray [...] that this Honourable Court will be pleased to add the annexed Regulations to the present Orders of Sessions or such part thereof as this Honorable Court in their Wisdom shall think proper with an Adequate Penalty for the Breach thereof And that this Honourable Court will be further

further pleased to alter the Hour from Seven to Six in the Morning for Carts to be on their Stands in Winter and to encrease the Penalty to 20s. or such other Sum as this Honourable Court shall think fit against any Person who shall place his Cart on any Stand before 4 o. Clock in Summer and Six in the Winter

And your Petitioners shall ever Pray Etca.
