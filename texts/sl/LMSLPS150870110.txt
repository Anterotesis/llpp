The Humble Petition and Appeal of the Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor of the Parish of Saint George in the County of Middlesex.

Sheweth, That by virtue of an Order of Removal under the Hands and Seals of Two of His Majesty's Justices of the Peace (to wit) John Sawbridge, Esquire, and Sir James Esdaile, Knight, (one being of the Quorum) for the City of London aforesaid, bearing date the twenty second day of April 1776 Ann the Wife of Phillip Pilgrim (who was then in the Poultry Compter in the said City of London confined for Debt) and her four Children (videlicet) George aged Five years and upwards, Harriot aged Three years and upwards, Houghton aged Eighteen months, and an Infant not then Christened aged Three Weeks were Removed from the parish of Allhallows Barking in the City of London to the said parish of Saint George And the said Two last mentioned Justices of the Peace for the said City of London and Liberties thereof in and by the said Order of Removal adjudged the last Legal Settlement of Phillip Pilgrim Husband of the said Ann to be in the said parish of Saint George by the Description of the parish of Saint George in the East in the County of Middlesex

That your Petitioners are advised and believe that the last legal Settlement of the said Phillip Pilgrim is not in the said parish of Saint George as by the said Order is supposed and therefore they conceive themselves to be aggrieved by the said Order and Determination of the said Two Justices and Do humbly appeal to your worships against the same

Your Petitioners therefore as well on the part and behalf of themselves as of the other Inhabitants and parishioners of the said parish of Saint George Do Humbly pray that the said Order of Removal of the said Ann the Wife of the said Phillips Pilgrim and her Four Children may be Quashed And that your Petitioners may be further and otherwise Relieved in the premises as to your Worships shall seem meet.

And your Petitioners will ever pray Etc
