To the Right Honourable and Worshipfull his Majesties Justices of the Peace for the City of London in Sessions Assembled

The Petition and Appeal of the Mayor and Commonally and Citizens of the City of London

Sheweth That your Petitioners are Assessed the Sum of Forty Pounds for one Years Rate towards the Relief of the Poor of the Parish of Saint Mary Woolchurch Haw within the City of London on Account of a House within the said Parish belonging to your Petitioners and now in the Occupation of the Lord Mayor of this City, which Sum ought not to have been assessed upon the Mayor Commonally and Citizens of London and is much more than ought to be assessed on Account of the said House, for which and other Reasons your Petitioners apprehend the said Rate and Assessment to be illegal and unjust and that the same ought to be quashed

Your Petitioners therefore pray that the said Rate and Assessment may be quashed or that your Petitioners may have such other Relief in the Premisses as to this Honourable Court shall seem just

And your Petitioners shall ever pray Etc.
