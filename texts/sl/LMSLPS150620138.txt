To the Rt. Honble: the Lord Mayor of the City of London the Aldermen and Justices at the Quarter Sessions

The humble Petition of the underwritten Subscribers on behalf of the Farmers and dealers in Corn throughout England

Sheweth That your Petitioners have reason to apprehend that an attempt will be made at this Honble. Court to open the Port of London for the Importation of Forreign Oats at the Lowest Duty, notwithstanding by all Accounts there are very large and good Crops of our own growth, but by wet Weather the Harvest being backwarded at least a Month they have been prevented from being brought to Market and the prices have greatly advanced yet as we humbly conceive and can make appear not so much as that now the common Market price of midling English Oats of this years growth exceeds Fifteen shillings per Quarter And as we have Accounts of great Quantities being shipd we doubt not but on their arrival the Prices will be lowerd much all which we humbly submit to this Honble. Court
