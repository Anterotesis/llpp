That in some time past yor. Petr. was by the Worpl. Justice Ward comitted to the Gatehouse at Westminster for an assault upon Frances this Wife where he still remaines Yor. Petr. not being then capeable of procureing bayle for his appearance. That yor. Petr. is sorry for the said offence and being now a Serjant in a Marine Regiment in which he hath belonged for the space of Twelve Months past and upwards, See that yor. Petr. is forced to be absent from his said service and doth thereby loose his pay which will tend to the utter ruine of yor. Petr. unless releived by yor. Worpps in the premisses.

Yor. Petr. therefore most humbly prays yor. Worps to be pleased to grant that he may be discharged from the said Imprisomnt. He being resolved never to offend in the like case.

And yor. Petr. shall ever pray Etc.
