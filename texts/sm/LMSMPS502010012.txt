To the Rt. Worspll. his Matys Justices of the Peace for the County of Middx

The humble Peticon of John Martin

Sheweth That Yor. Peticoner was indicted last Sessions by one Martha Harris for an Assault & that yor. Peticoner was taken up by a Bench Warrt. and comitted to New Prison for want of Suretys

That Yor. Peticoner stands indicted a Second time is this Honble Court for keeping a disorderly Collar in White Chappell. That Yor. Petr. is innocent of the sd two Indictments That Yor. Petr. did serve his late Maty King William, the late Queen and his now prsent Maty King George and is now disabled That he has been a Sailor 26 years & being a very poor man having a Wife and six Children (four whereof are very small) to maintain is not in a Capacity to try the sd two Indictmts. therefore he must confess the Same So that he must inevitably rely upon this Honble Bench for Mercy Yor. Petr. having Severall persons now in Court that will prove the Said Harris a very wicked woman

Yor. Petr. therefore most humbly Prays Yor. Worspps to be pleased to consider his sad v deplorable Condition and to releive him in the sd prmisses

And yor. petr. shall ever pray Etc.
