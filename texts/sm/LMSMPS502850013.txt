To Valentine Hilder Esqr & the Rest of the Worship full Justices of this Bench

The Humble: Peticon of Nicolas Corner

Sheweth That Your Peticoner stands Indicted on a Cross Indictmt: before this Worship full Court, to which he pleaded & Traversed ye last Sessions in order to try this Sessions. But so it is, may it please Yr Worship's, that two of his most materiall Witnesses, (one of them a Barnet & Knight of [...] Shire in Parliament & the Other a Gent: who is sane where on a Progress in the Country), are at so great Distance That they could not possibly be procured to Attend this Sessions & two Other Witnesses having removed their habitations can not Possibly at present be found as will Appear by an Affidavitt ready to be produced

Wherefore Yr Petitioner humbly prays that his Recognizance may be respited till ye next Sessions when yr. Petitioner will use all possible means to have his Witnesses ready to proceed to Tryall

And Yr Peticoner shall Ever pray Etc
