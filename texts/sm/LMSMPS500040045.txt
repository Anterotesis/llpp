To ye Honble their Maties Justices of ye Peace of ye County of Middlesex now holding their Sessions for ye Sd County.

The humble Petition of Sr Richard Bulkeley Bartt, John Jeffrey for Esqr Sarjeant at Law, and Charles Davenant Doctor of Laws all of RedLyon Square in ye Parish of St Andrews Holborn, in behalf of themselves and divers Nobility and Gentry Inhabitants of ye Sd Space

Sheweth That ye Taxes upon ye Sd Inhabitants of RedLyon Square for ye Scavengers and Rakers have of late been much raisd; and that Since ye Sd Augmentation, ye sd Inhabitants have been so very much neglected by ye Sd Scavengers and Rakers, that ye great quantity of Dirt which has layn in ye Square ye whole Winter past, has much kindred ye letting of ye Houses in ye sd Square, besides ye continuall inconvenience thereof at that time to ye Inhabitants. and also by its being Since not taken away but dryed up, they are now no less annoyd by ye Dust, to ye great Damage of their furniture and household Goods. They do further shew that many of them have been very frequently robbd both by day and by night, through ye Neglect if not connivance of ye Watchmen, who are wholly Strangers and unknown to ye sd Inhabitants.

The sd Inhabitants do therefore pray, that this Bench would be pleasd to grant them an Order of Sessions, to appoint Such Persons to be their Scavengers and Rakers as they themselves shall agree withall, over whom they can have Authority in Case of any Neglect. And that ye sd Persons may have ye Same Authority to levy such Tax, as the Such Persons were ye Parish Scavengers. And they do further pray and desire that they themselves may constitute a private Watch for ye sd square, to keep constant attendance therein; and that therefore they may be exempted from ye Charge of ye Parish Watch, forasmuch as ye Charge of that private Watch will be much greater then their present Tax for ye Publick Watch. In wages & in building convenient Stands for ye same.
