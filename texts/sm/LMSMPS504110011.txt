To the Worshipful his Majesties Justices of the Peace for the County of Middlesex in their General Session of the Peace Assembled

The Humble Petition of John Taylor

Sheweth That your Petitioner is an Inhabitant of the Parish of Saint James Clerkenwell in this County and on Easter Monday last was Chosen Constable of the Close Liberty in the said Parish for one whole year then next evening

That there is a Custom in the said Parish for every Constable so chosen to chose and Ellect a Headborough to serve under him in consequence of which your Petitioner chose one Ebenezer Coker an Inhabitant of the said Parish to be his Headborough but the Magistrates acting for Finsbury Division at a Petit Sessions were pleased to discharge the said Ebenezer from acting as Headborough

That your Petitioner thereupon chose one John Cowell an Inhabitant of the said Parish and a fit & able Person to be his Headborough in the Room of the said Ebenezer Coker and gave the said John Cowel notice thereof that the might take the Oath of Office of Headborough but the said John Cowel absolutely refuses so to do insisting he is not properly chosen for that the Choice of the said Ebenezer Coker made as aforesaid ought to stand by reason whereof the said Liberty is now & is Likely to be without a Head borough for the Remaining part of the Year

Your Petr. thereof one humbly Pray your Worships to Order that the said John Cowel may attend this Honourable to shew cause why he refuses to take upon him & to be Sworn into the said Office of Headborough

And Your Petr. will ever Pray Jno Taylor
