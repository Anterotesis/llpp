Sheweth That by an Order of John Brettell and Thomas Collins Esquires two of his Magesty's Justices of the Peace for the said County bearing date the 11th. of July 1795 it was Ordered that a certain footway in the parish of Finchley in the Division and Hundred of Ossulton leading from a certain Walk called Love walk across a certain Field belonging to William Steer Esquire to a certain Brook called Brent Brook for the length of five hundred and fifty three Yards should be diverted and turned this the Field aforesaid, and that in consequence of the said Order the said foot path was strreet up and has continued so to be altho' for a great length of time no other path was opened and completed and so certified which ought to have been done before the old path should have been shut in compliance with the Act of Parliament in that case made and provided. And your petitioner further says that the path way which has been since made in line of the old foot path is extremely inconvenient and dangerous as well from the natural condition of the Ground over which it is made as from the annoyance of the Carriages and Cattle which pass and repass this and upon the same.

That

That your Petitioner therefore conceives that he is injured and aggrieved by the said Order.

Your Petitioner therefore prays that the Order and return may not be entered and recorded by the Clerk of the Peace of the said County but that your Petitioner may be heard be his Counsel against the same, and that the benefit of this his Appeal may be saved unto him, and the hearing and determining [---] thereof adjourned until the next General Quarter Sessions of the Peace to be holden for the said County.

And your Petitioner shall ever pray Etc
