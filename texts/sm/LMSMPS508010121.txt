Middlesex To the worshipful William Mainwaring Esqr. Chairman of the Session, and the rest of his Majesty's Justices of the Peace now Assembled

The Petition of Edward Hall

Humbly Sheweth That previous to the appointment of the late John Harrow (deceased) to take care of the gallary door in the Court your petitioner apply'd for the assistance of a Porter or Person to be subject to his Command during Sessions who might not only take care of the gallary doors, but open and shut the doors of the Court and Session House to clear away Idle and suspicious persons and to keep the Court clean and in good Order during Sessions

But learning it was the intention of the Court (from motives of humanity) to appoint the said John Harrow your petitioner therefore declined his application

That your petitioner doth now resume his application as above stated, and that your petitioner doth not crave more assistance than his predecessor formerly had in a much less Building

And that your petitioner begs leave to add that having several times mentioned to the Court how much his Situation and this Building is exposed to the Public, by the way to the Clerk of the Peace office communicating with the Center

of the Building which has lay'd open to the Public over since your petitioner resided inch which makes it impossible for your petitioner to consider himself, his Family and property Safe from the depredations of Thiefs and Robbers neither is it possible (so exposed) to be a accountable for the property that belongs to your Worships

Your petitioner therefore prays your Worships will be pleased to grant him such assistance as will not only greatly relieve him, but greatly [...] to the good Order of the Court, And that if it be not eligible at present to shut out the Public in a permanent manner, your petitioner prays your worships will be pleased, to do it in a Temporary way which your petitioner suggests may be done at a Trifling expence there being some space doors and other materials in the Building that may be apply'd in a Temporary way for the purpose above stated

And your petitioner as in Duty Bound will ever pray
