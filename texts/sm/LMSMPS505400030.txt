To the Right Honourable Francis Cakayne Esqr. Lord Mayor of the City of London and to the Aldermen of the same City.

The Humble Petition of the several Journey men Taylors in the said City.

Humbly Sheweth That by an Act of Parliament made in the 7th. Year of the Reign of King George the first for regulating the Journeymen Taylors within the weekly Bills of Mortality It is amongst other Things enacted that the Hours of Work for all Journeymen Taylors Servants and Apprentices to Taylors and other Persons employed or to be employed or retained as Taylors in making up Mens or Women's Cloaths or such Servant or Apprentices within the Citys of London and Westminster or either of them or within the Weekly Bills of Mortality shall be from Six of the Clock in the Morning untill Eight of the Clock at Night Excepting only that there shall be allowed by the Master one Penny half Penny a Day for Breakfast and one Hour for Dinner in the Time aforesaid and for the said Time or Hours of Work aforesaid there shall be paid unto every Journeyman Taylor or other Person employed or to be employed or retained as a Journeyman Taylor for his Work during the Hours aforesaid the Wages and Sums following (that is to say) From the 25th. Day of March to the 24th. Day of June any Sum or Sums not exceeding Two Shillings a Day, and for the rest of the Year One Shilling and Eight Pence a Day.

That the Legislature then perceiving it would be reasonable and necessary upon some Occasions thereafter to alter the Wages and Hours of Work aforesaid It is thereby further enacted that it shall and may be lawfull to and for the Justices of the Peace in their respective Jurisdictions within the Limits aforesaid at their General Quarter Sessions and they are thereby authorized and required upon Application to be made to then for that Purpose to take into their Consideration the Plenty or Scarcity of the Time, and other Circumstances necessary to be considered and to alter the Wages and Hours of Work aforesaid And to order and appoint what Wages and Allowances shall be paid or made to Journeymen Taylors and Servants retained or employed in the Art or Mistery of a Taylor as aforesaid within the Limits aforesaid and what Hours they shall work and shall make such Alterations therein from Time to Time as such Justices at such General Sessions shall think fit upon Application to be made to them for

for that Purpose And such Justices shall within the Space of Fourteen Days next after such General Sessions cause such Rates and Alterations from Time to Time to be printed published and made known in such Manner also them shall seem meet at the reasonable Expence of any Person or Persons desiring the same And for and after Publication thereof all Taylors and their Journeymen and Servants within the Limits aforesaid are hereby strictly required to observe the same upon Pain of Imprisonment by such Justices for any Time not exceeding two Months being lawfully convicted of such Offence after Knowledge or Information of any such Rates or Alterations thereof to be made as aforesaid upon any Prosecution to be commenced within Six Days after the Offence committed.

That since the making the above Act the Price of Labour in all Trades and Business is much encreased of which the Master Taylors are so sensible that the greatest Part and the mosteminent amongst them have for several Years past paid their Journeymen Two Shillings and Six Pence a Day all the Year.

That your Petitioners were untill the late Disputes between the Masters and their Journeymen in Middlesex entirely ignorant of the said Act and the Penalties incurred by paying and receiving more Wages than by the said Act is allowed for Want of having an Order or Appointment made for the Payment of the same by your Worships in Pursuance to the Power oested in you by the said Act.

Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Worships will be pleased to alter the Wages and the Hours of Working mentioned in the said Act, And to order that every Master Taylor, residing in the said City, Do and shall pay unto every Journeyman Taylor, for his Work, Two Shillings and Six Pence a Day, and that the Hours of Working be appointed to be from six of the Clock in the Morning to six of the Clock at Night, or that your Worships will be pleased to make such other Order or Appointment in the Premises as to your Worships shall seem meet.

And your Petitioners shall ever pray Etc
