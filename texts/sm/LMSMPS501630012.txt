Sheweth That the Last Sessions an Appeal was tried in this Court between the Parish of St. Andrews Holborn and the Parish of Totinham, and it was adjudg'd by this Court that the Petr. did belong to the Parish of St Andrew Holborn, who refuse to relieve her ever [...] because the Church Wardens of Talinham refuse to draw up the said Order, and deliver the Petitionr according to Law.

Your Petr therefore most humbly prays that the Church wardens of Totinham may attend this Court to show cause why they do not draw up the said Order, or take care of her and her Children: for till they draw up the said Ordered that She may be Settled in St Andrews Holborn, she is Neg [...] and both she and her poor son that is blind deaf and Sensless, and utterly uncapable of relieving himself in any manner must undoubledly perish

And Yor. Petr. Shall ever Pray Etc.
