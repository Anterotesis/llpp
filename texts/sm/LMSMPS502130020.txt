To the Honble: the Bench of Justices at Hicks Hall

The Humble Petition of Samuell Addis

Sheweth That at a Tryall before this Honble: Bench last Thursday Your Petitr. was fined Ten pounds for a Trespass and Assault on one Samll. Sparks

That Your Petitr. the next day being brot. up from New Prison before this Honble. Bench, the Court was Pleased out of Compassion to your Petitrs. Poor and mean Circumstances to mitigate and moderate the Said Fine of Ten pounds to the Sume of forty Shillings which Sume of forty Shillings Your Petitr. Since has rais'd amengst his friends in order to have paid the Same in hopes to have been discharg'd And Yor. Petitr. has also two Genll. releases ready to be executed between Yor. Petitr. And the Prosecutor Samll. Sparks according to the directions of the Court on Paymt. of Forty shillings But Your Petitr. to his great Surprize finds by the return of the Calendar to the Prison that the Fine of ten pounds stands fully charged agt. Yor. Petisr. without the least Notice taken of the Same being mitigated and Sett to Forty Shillings. which must needs be agreat Mistake of the Clerks. And as your Petitr. is not able to pay the Sd. ten pounds

Yor. Petitr. most humbly prays That Yor. Worshipps and order Yor. Petitr. forthwith to be call'd up And that this Honble Court will relifie the Mistake in the Calendar and accept of the Fine of forty Shillings to be paid as it was formerly order'd

And yor. Petitr Shall ever pray Etc.
