The Humble Petition of Barzilas Herbert

To The Honble: Bench of Justices

Humbly Sheweth Whereas yor: Petitioner Bar. Herbert was (about eighteen months ago) Spitefully & maliciously without any just & lawful reason, Indicted by one William Collings. But some time after his malice being pacified the sd. Wm: Collings promis'd to proceed no farther in this, or any other such malicious prosecution, and also that he would take up the Recognizance made against me any pay what cost or charges had, or should from thence accrue. But yor: Petitr: Humbly conceives, the sd. Collings did not, That yor: Petr: hath several times since come at Court (when cal'd to his great expence, besides loss of time) but sd. Collings never appeard, Several others have since also illegally extorted money from yor. poor Petir: on pretence of discharging the Court, and from any future expence on that afair; particularly one, Nichols to whome yor: Petir: pd. fifteen shillings, for wch he brought a receipt in full from Mr. Jno Rolph Notwithstanding all this, yor: Petir: finding other demds: on him, & not being willing, nor capable, of withstanding vexations law suits

Therefore yor: Petir: most humbly prays this Honble: Bench to take it into consideration, and grant that yor: Petir: may have liberty to take up his Recognizance & be discharg'd from this unjust prosecute any yor: Petr: Shall (as in duty bound) always Pray Etc
