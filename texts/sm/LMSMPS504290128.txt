The humble Petition and Appeal of the several Persons whose names are hereunto subscribed Inhabitants and Housholders in the Parish of Saint George in the County of Middlesex on behalf of themselves and the rest of the Inhabitants of the said Parish

Sheweth That in the Year 1751 one William Smith and several others Inhabitants of the said Parish of St. George exhibited their Appeal against a Rate or Assessment made for Relief of the Poor of the said Parish for the sd: Year, Alledging that there then was in the Hands Custody or Possession of the Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor or in the Hands Custody or possion of Trustees appointed for that purpose for the Use of the poor of the said Parish in Government Securities and Money, £1093,,8,,7, and which had been raised on the Inhabitants and Housholders of the said Parish for the Support and maintenance of the poor of the same Parish, and that no Sum or Sums of Money ought or should be raised on the said Inhabitants and Housholders of the said Parish for the Support and Maintenance of the Poor of the said Parish until all such Sum & Sums of Money which was then in the Hands possion or Custody of the said Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor and Trustees as aforesaid of the said Parish should be expended applied and laid out for the purposes for which such Sum & Sums of Money had been raised; Which said Appeal was heard in December Sessions in the said Year 1751, when the Court quashed the said Rate, and it was then agreed in open Court that no Costs should be paid to the Appellants.

That on the first day of August in the Year aforesaid at a Publick Vestry held pursuant to Notice published in the Church according to the Custom of the said Parish, a Committee was appointed in order to purchase a Set of Bells for the Use of the said Parish, who having afterwards purchased a Set applied for a Faculty to hang them up, but a Caveat having been entred against granting the Faculty by the said William Smith, a Suit was commenced in Doctors Commons, and the Sense of the Parish being almost unanimous for Bells, the said Caveat was at length withdrawn & a Faculty granted.

That in the Year 1752 the said William Smith (who is a Quaker) got himself with one Josiah Hoskins another Quaker and two others to be confirmed Overseers of the Poor (tho' they had all before served that Office) and contrary to the Custom of the said Parish chose the said Josiah Hoskins

Hoskins Expenditor (the Junior Churchwarden having always except in one Instance been Expenditor) and the said Hoskins hath delivered in an Account verified on his Affirmation as one of the Overseers and Expenditor for the poor of the sd. parish, in which he hath charged, paid to the sd. William Smith Disbursements at Hicks Hall £7,,15,,-, Proctor's Bill £43,,16,,-, tho' it was absolutely agreed in open Court at Hicks Hall on hearing the Appeal aforesaid that no Costs should be paid; and tho' the Suit in Doctors Commons was against the Inclination of the whole Inhabitants of the sd. Parish declared in several publick Vestry one in particular, held for the very purpose of taking the Sense of the Inhabitants in regard to Bells.

Your Petitrs: think themselves aggrieved by the said Account of the said Josiah Hoskins, and Appeal to this Court against the same, and humbly pray Your Worships to give them such Relief therein as you shall think Just.

And your Petitrs: shall ever pray
