To the Honble the Commons of Great Britain in Parliament Assembled

The Humble Petition of his Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the County of Middx in Session assembled on Behalf of themselves and the Rest of the Inhabitants of the said County

Sheweth That your Petitioners Observe by the Votes of this Honble House that a Petition of the Ld. Mayor Aldermen and Commons of the City of London in Common Council Assembled hath been lately Presented to this Honble House setting forth that the goal of Newgate is the Common Goal for the City of London and County of Middlesex that the Prisioners committed thereto have for several Years past been communibres Annis near one thousand Persons two thirds of whom have been Middlesex Prisoners-That the said Goal is a very ancient ill constructed close and incommodious Building and in its present state unfit for the reception of prisoners committed her-That the present state and Condition of the said goal merits the attention of the legislature-That upon an examination and Survey of the said goal it appears that the same cannot be rendered healthy and Commodious without being taken down and rebuilt on a more extended Plan and that the Petitioners are ready and willing to do every Thing towards the Promoting that Work that on their part can be equitably Expected or required but that the same cannot be carried into execution without the aid and Authority of Parliament.

Your Petitioners on their part humbly beg leave to represent to this Honble. House. That the Goal is supposed to have been originally built in the Reign of Thing Henry the first or of King Stephen, that is to say, between the years 1100, and 1154, and that the same hath been under the sole Government of and hath from time to time some times by express mandate from the King been rebuilt repaired Actered and enlarged by the City of London.

That supposing the Number of Prisoners yearly Committed to the said Goal to he as great as is alledged and that two thirds of such Prisoners an Middlesex Prisoners the latter of whiich positions your Petitioners do by no means admit.

Your Petitioners say that the Number is not greater now but is rather less than it hath been for a long Series of years past.

That the County of Middlesex have several prisons of their own which they maintain at a great expence wherein through the Providence of God and the great Care that hath been constantly

taken to keep the same clean and to prevent the accumulation of Filth no Malignant Disease hath ever yet appeared To which prisoners [...] for all but the most atracious Offences are committed and that the sole. Reason why any Middlesex prisoners at all are in Newgate is that the Citizens of London do by their several Charters among divers other Valuable Priviledges and Immunities held the Shrievalty of Middlesex together with that of London in Farm and that as they Unite those two several Offices and the Jurisdictions attendant thereon in the same Person so do they make the Prison of Newgate which is situated in and is properly the Prison of London a Prison for the County of Middlesex.

That therefore the Custody of the Middlesex Prisioners is not to be Considered as a burthen on the Citizens but as a necessary Consequence of their Nomination of the same Persons as are sheriffs of London to be Sheriff of Middlesex the Right to which Nomination could never have been forced on them, they must necessarily be supposed originally to have Solicited it and the rather as they Constantly exercise it and under Colour thereof have for many years past raised immonse Sums in Proof whereof your Petitioners alledge that since the year 1672 the Amount of Sheriffs Fines hath been upwards of £148750, a sufficient part whereof your Petitioners humbly apprehend might very Properly have been applied by the Citizens for the rebuilding of their Goal of Newgate as it is in Judgment of Law the prison of the Sheriffs.

That although it is now upwards of 600 years since the first Building of the said Goal no attempt hath ever been made to Charge the County of Middlesex with any expence attending the same but on the Contrary at a Time of Publick Calamity (Vizt.) immediately after the Dreadful Conflagration in 1666, when the real Distresses of the Citizens might oblige them to Implore the aid of Parliament they without any Previous application to the County of Middlesex obtained for the Purpose of Building Prisons for Felons and other Malefactors (among other things) a Grant of a very Considerable Revenue by a Duty on Coals which hath produced to the city no less a Sum than £736804.

That how much soever your Petitioners may be disposed to Camont that notwithstanding

the many Alterations Additions and Improvements that have from time to time been made by the Citizens in and to the said Goal it is still ill Constructed Close in commodious unhealthy they humbly hope that the County of Middx is not Answerable for any of the bad Consequences of its Construction or Situaton in as much as the City and not the County have made it what it is

That it is evident by the above state of fasts that the Citizens have been possessed of at least two Funds amounting together to near a Millian sterling out of which for ought that has ever yet appeared to the publick they might have rebuilt their Goal of Newgate without any aid of the County which already in taxed at near £1000 a year for the Maintenance of its own Goals and other purposes by a County rate of which rate your Petitioners as justices of the Peace Conceive themselves the Guardians.

That the Revenues of the City are immense the Offices in their disposal so long ago as the year 1721 were estimated at £152000, and a very few years will put the Citizens in the actual Possession and receipt of such Estates as must yield an Income much more than adequate to the expences [...]

That as the Source of these Revenues are in general Royal grants many of them under the express Condition of well Governing the City and are enjoyed by the Citizens in their political and Corporate capacity the Revenues arising by Virtue of these Grants cannot be considered as private emoluments in reason and justice they ought to be applied only for public purposes and as your petitioners humbly Conceives the defraying the necessary expences of Magistracy the erection and repair of Goals bridges and other publick Offices are some of those beneficial purposes for which such Grants seem Originally to have been intended and to which the Revenue thereby arising are with the greatest propriety applicable.

For all which several reasons above mentioned as also for divers others of sing a Car wright and Importance which your Petitioners have to offer they do deny that the said Goal ought to be Rebuilt at the Expence of the City of London and County of Middex in any Proportion whatever-on the Contrary they say and doubt not by the

did of this Honourable House to Prove that the [---] Citizens are by Law bound and according to the Principals of reason and Justice they Submit that they ought at the sole Expence of the City to rebuild and repair the said Goal whenever the same shall be necessary.

Wherefore your Petitioners most humbly pray this Honble House that they may be heard by themselves or their Council against the Matters Contained in the said [---] Petitions so far as the same may any way tend to Impose a Charge on the said County.

And your Petitioners shall ever pray Etc
