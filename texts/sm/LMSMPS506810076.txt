John aged about 12 years, and Frederick aged about 4 years and 7 Months, and that his sd. Wife is now Pregnant with Child by him and very near the time of her delivery.

That sevl. Months ago the sd. Alexr. Fenton ran away and left his sd. Wife and two Children in the Parish of St. James Westmr. and they being likely to become chargeable there were Removed by an order of 2 Justices from thence to the sd. Parish of St. Giles, to which sd. Last mentioned Parish they have been actually chargeable during about 6 Weeks last past the sd. Alexander Fenton having refused to allow his sd. Family any relief or Support altho he can and Constantly does earn one Guinea and nine Pence per week at his Business of a Taylor & they were in great distress and totally incapable of procuring a maintenance

That when the sd. Family first become chargeable as afsd. your Petitioners made complaint against the said Alexr. Fenton to David Walker Esqr. one of this Majestys Justices of the Peace for the sd.

Alex Fenton as a Rogue & Vagabond, Who was there upon taken into custody and conveyed before Thomas Bishop Esqr. at the Rotation Office in Litch field Street, where he positively declared that he wd. not allow his said Wife or Children any Relief nor Indemnify the Parish from the charge of maintaining them and added that he knew the Magistrate could only Commit him to the House of Correction until the Sessions when he wd. be Discharged of course and in the mean time could live as well in Prison as out.

That your Petrs. having already been put to considerable expence in maintaining the sd. Family & there being a great probability of such charge not only continuing but encereasing by reason of the Pregnancy of the sd. Sarah, without any view of procuring an Indemnity the sd. Alexr. Fenton
