To the Rt. Worshipll. his Majties Justices of the Peace for the County of Middx in their Genll. qrter. Sessions assembled

The Humble Peticon of Mary Smith an Apprentice to Elizabeth Mathews of the parish of St. George in the County of Middx Spinster

Sheweth That by Indenture bearing date the twelfth day of March in ye year one Thousand seven Hundred and thirty five [...] your Petr. Mary Smith was put and bound an Apprentice to the said Elizabeth Mathews for the Term of five years to learn her Art and Skill of making Women's Cloathes (as is set forth in the said Indenture)

That yor. petrs. Father did pay five pounds to the sd Elizabeth Mathews wth. the said Apprentice, to instruct her in her sd Art and Skill And yor. petrs. said Father was to find and provide for the sd Apprentice all and all manner of wearing Apparrel during the said Term

But yor. petr. instead of working at her sd Trade (which would wear out but few Cloathes) is Constantly Employed in some laborions Works abt. the House, as Washing Scowering, cleaning of Rooms & such like, by which means yor. petr. wears out more Cloathes and Apparrel than her sd Father is able to provide for her

And notwithstanding the sd Sume of Â£5. was so payd wth. yor. sd. Petr. as afore sd, the same is not menconed in the Body of the sd Indenture not the Duty payd for the same as by Law is required

Yor. Petr. therefore finding herselfe aggrieved by the sd Indenture of Apprentiship, most humbly Appeals agt. the same

And prays yor. worships would be pleased to Order that the said Elizabeth Mathews together wth. her said Apprentice Mary Smith do attend this Honble. Court some Day this present Sessions to hear and abide the Judgment of the said Court touching the sd Appeal, and to shew Cause why yor. petr. should not be discharged from her sd Apprentiship, and why the sd Sume of five pounds so payd as aforesd, should not be returned

And yor. Petr. shall ever pray Etc.
