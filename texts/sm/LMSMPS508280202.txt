the Worshipfull his Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the County of Middlesex in Session assembled,

The humble Petition of Several of the Inhabitants of the parishes of Isleworth, Twickenham, and the parts adjacent, Subscribers towards the rebuilding a Bridge at Isleworth, called the Rails Head Bridge.

Sheweth

That, on a Memorial being presented last year to your Worships by your Petition :ers, (which was taken into Consideration last December Sessions, and Counsel heard and Evidence given in support of it) your Worships were pleased to order, that the Sum of one hundred pounds should be paid out of the County Rate, in aid of the Subscription stated in the said Memorial to be, then raised, and raising for the purpose of rebuilding the said Bridge, provided the Subscribers would undertake to rebuild the same According to the Plan and Estimate annexed to the said Memorial, and that when the same should be so rebuilt, it should in future to deemed a County Bridge, agreable to a Determination of the Court of Kings Bench, on which the said Memorial was four did, which the Committee who attened the hearing, on behalf of themselves and the other Memorialists, Acceded to, and undertook to do the work on those terms, and have compleated the same accodingly, But that a doubt being suggested at the time of the said hearing, by one of the Magistrates, on eminert Architect, whether the Waterway Provided for by the Arches, Specified in the Plan annexed to the Memorial, would be quite sufficient, for the great weight of water that sometimes after violent rains must pass through the same, It was recommended by the Chairman, with the Approbation of the other magistrates present, to the said Committee and their Architect Mr Payne, to make particular enquiry into that matter, and, if necessary, by enlarging the Arches, to prevent (as for as possible) any danger in time of floods to the new intended Bridge, and Consequently any future Expence to the County.

That in Obedience to such Recommend action they made very diligent enquiry, away the oldest Inhabitants and others, concerning the height and rapidity of the most violent floods rememberd there, and after such inquiry, thought it expedient at least, to alter the Plan, and by enlarging it, and making the arches both higher and wider, to provide more waterway, to prevent (as for as could be) any possibility of the new

dge suffering damage from Floods, and thereby quetting the County to future Charges,

That in consequence of such enlarged. Plan, the Expence has increased very Considerably, beyond the first Estimate, which amounted only to 273:19:4, whereas The Sum Contracted to be paid for rebuilding the same, as it is now rebuilt, amounts to 328 to, besides a Considerable Expence in extra Works, that Could not be included in the first Estimate, or the Contract, making together Eighty pounds at Least:

That Your Petitioners also beg leave to mention, that the Road Dading to the Bridge, particularly at the West End, was so Low, owing in a great measure to the heightening the Arches, in Obedience to the above Mentioned Recommendation, from your Worships, that it has cost a considerable extra Sum to raise the same, and make the Access Easy, not Less then £20. Which, at the time they were covering the Bridge with Gravel, they likewise did, although, when the Bridge was build, it being then by virtue of your worships resolution a County Bridge; the repair and raising of such Road was a Charge on the County, as being within 300 fact of the Ends of the said Bridge.

As Therefore Petitioners have [...] of the work expended at least and Hundred Pounds beyond what was first Calcuted, partly in obedience to your recom Mendation, in order to prevent furture Expence to the County, and party in doing a work, that was strictly and legally a Charge on the County rate, and as the Subscription Already raised, together with the £100 given by the County, falls short of the whole Expense 145:10:4, as by a Particular Account hereto annexed, which they fear it will be difficult to raise by a second Subscription; although past of it May be,

They humbly pray your worships to take the promisses into your Consideration, and order such further Sum to be paid put of the County rate, towards Compleating the payment of the Expenses incurred by so useful a work as in your Discration you shall think fit.

James Clitherow: John Taylour J; Franks W Drake I:Godfrey Ilippisley The Comtee appoint for the Execution of the work in behalf of ourselves & the rest of the Subscribers Decr. 13th 1787}
