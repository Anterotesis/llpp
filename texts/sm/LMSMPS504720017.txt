To the Worshipfull Bench of His Majesty's Justices of the peace, at Westminster Hall

The Humble petition of Elizabeth Allen

Humbly Sheweth

That your poor petitioner was sent to Bridewell three Sessions's ago being Charged (the Innocent) of taking a Guinea in the Stead of a Farthing for Burgamy Pears, from a Child belonging to Mr. Goodchild at the Hole in the Wall in King Street Westminster. And as I am a poor woman and this affair has render'd me uncapable of getting my Bread, Most Humbly beg that your Worships will take my case into your wife consideration, and bring my Tryal on this Sessions, as I am ready to answer in Court to the things that Mr. Goodchild has Objected against me. And as in Duty bound will ever pray
