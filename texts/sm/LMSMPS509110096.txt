To the Worshipful the Chairman and the rest of His Majestys Justices of the Peace for the County of Middlesex in their General Quarter Session of the Peace Assembled

The Humble Petition of Abraham Sears

Sheweth That your Petr. hath been Beadle of the Parish of St. Luke Chelsea upwards of [...] years and always lived in good credit and reputation until the circumstances happened which has brought him under his present most unfortunate Predicament of being sentenced by this Honble. Court to a months Imprisonment and a Publick Whipping

That after a veridict of a Jury and the Sentence of this Honble Court your Petr. could not without unpardonable presumption plead his innocency of intention in the matter which he has been charged but he most humbly hopes that there will be no impropriety in urging that what he did was at an unguarded moment; and for [...] he has ever since been sincerely sorry; And that the smallness of the value of the Article and other circumstances of the Case will be admitted as some extennation

That if your unfortunate Petr. undergoes that Part of the Sentence which insticts a publick Whipping it will be his entire Ruin; and what is even worse, will in tail such disgrace on his afflicted Wife, Children, and other innocent Relations as will be the Severest affliction to him

Your Petr. therefore most humbly Prays this Honble. Court to take his Case into their human Consideration And that Your Worships will be graciously pleased to remit that part of his Sentence which Consists of a publick Whipping

And Your Petr. as in duty bound will ever Pray
