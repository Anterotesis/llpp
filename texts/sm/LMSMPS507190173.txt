To the Worshipfull His Majestys Justices of the Peace for the County of Middlesex in their General Session of the Peace in and for the said County Assembled

The Humble Petition and Appeal of Jacob Leroure Esquire an Inhabitant and Occupier of a Messuage or Tenement in the Parish of Hadley in the said County

Sheweth That by virtue of a Tax Rate or Assessment made by the Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor of the said Parish of Hadley according to a Pound Rate for and towards the Relief of the Poor of the said Parish bearing date the Twenty Second day of November now last past your Petitioner is Taxed Rated and Assessed at and after the yearly Rent of Forty pounds for the Messuage or Tenement with the Appartenances in his Occupation in the said Parish

That the said Rate or Assessment is very unequal and disproportionate by reason that your Petitioner is thereby charged at more than the real annual value of the said Premises in his occupation while many other Inhabitants and Occupiers of Lands Tenements and Hereditaments within the

the said Parish are Rated and Assessed at less sums than the Annual value of their respective Possessions Rateable to the Relief of the Poor, particularly that Mr. William Smith who Actually Rents and Occupies Lands Tenements and Hereditaments within the said Parish at the yearly Rent of Fifty three Pounds and Ten Shillings is Rated at only Thirty Pounds per annum That Mr. Cutting Smith is Rated at Thirty five Pounds per Annum and Mr. John Morlar at Thirty Pounds which said two last mentioned Persons are Occupiers of much larger and more valuable Possessions chargeable to the Rate for the Relief of the Poor of the said Parish than those in the Occupation of your Petitioner; And That there are many other Persons who are Rateable to the Poor for their Possessions in the said Parish who are charged at a much less sum than your Petitioner is charged although their said Possessions are of very superior value to his

That the said Rate is in other respects made in a very partial and unjust manner there being many Lands Tenements and Hereditaments within the said Parish, Chargeable to the Assessment for the Relief of the Poor which are totally omitted or left out of the said Rate particularly a

a Farm at Forty Pounds per annum in the Occupation of Mr. Charles Cottrell which he rents of the Revd. Mr. Burrows

Your Petitioner finds himself Aggrieved by the said Rate or Assessment and by the Acts and Conduct of the Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor of the said Parish of Hadley in making the same Therefore Humbly Appeals to this Court against the same, and Prays your Worships to Appoint a Day in this present Session to hear and determine the said Appeal

And your Petitioner will Pray etc

Herbt. Robertson Solr. for the Appellts.
