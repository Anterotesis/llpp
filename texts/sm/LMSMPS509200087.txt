To the Worshipful his Majestys Justices of the Peace for the County of Middlesex in their General Quarter Session of the Peace assembled

The Humble Petition and Appeal of John Buckingham of the Parish of St Giles in the Fields in the said County Flax Dresser

Sheweth That by Indenture of Apprenticeship bearing date the 30th day of July in the Year One Thousand Seven Hundred and Ninety two the then Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor of the Parish of Richmond in the County of Surrey by and with the consent of two of his Majestys Justices of the Peace for the said last mentioned County Suit and Placed Sarah Wallis then aged about fifteen Years a Poor Child of the said Parish of Richmond Apprentice to your Petitioner with him to dwell and serve from the day of the date of the said Indenture until the said Sarah Wallis Should accomplish her age of Twenty one Years or day of Marriage according to the statute in that Case made and Provided And that the said Sarah Wallis served your Petitioner about nine Months under the said Indenture part of such service being in the said Parish of St Giles in the Fields and other part (your Petitioner apprehends and believes the last Forty days) thereof in the Parish of Hendon in the said County of Middlesex, and during the latter part of her said Service she greatly misbehaved herself and without any just or reasonable Cause or Provocation ran away and absented herself from the service of your Petitioner in or about the Month of April which was in the Year One Thousand Seven Hundred and Ninety three and your Petitioner could not discover where she went nor did he see her again (except on one single day) nor Know where she was till some time in the Month of November last when he was applied to by some of the Officers of the said Parish of Hendon and informed by them that she had then lately been sent to that Parish and was then therein and had voluntarily made oath before John Bond Esquire one of his Majestys Justices of the Peace for the said County of Middlesex That She

she was then Pregnant with a Child or Children likely to be born a Bastard or Bastards

That the said Officers of Hendon when they applied to your Petitioner as aforesaid desired your Petitioner to take the said Sarah Wallis again into his Service which your Petitioner refused to do on account of her long absence and misbehaviour particularly her then disgraceful State of Pregnancy whereupon your Petitioner was Summoned to appear before the sitting Justices at the Publick Office in Bow Street Covent Garden in the said County of Middlesex to answer the Complaint of the said Sarah Wallis and upon his appearance there he still refused for the reasons aforesaid to receive her again into his Service whereupon the said Justices bound your Petitioner in a Recognizance to appear at the last General Sessions of the Peace which was held for the said County and your Petitioner appeared accordingly in this Court on the County day of the said last General Sessions in expectation that this Court would have heard the said Sarah Wallis (she being then present) and also your Petitioner upon the matters of complaint that he then appeared to answer and that this Court would thereupon have Discharged the said Sarah Wallis from her Apprenticeship but in stead thereof this Court (as your Petitioner then understood) referred the matter back to two Justices out of Sessions whereupon your Petitioner went with the said Sarah Wallis before the sitting Justices at the said Publick Office in Bow Street, and after two hearings there on two different days before Nicholas Bond and John Bond Esquires two of the said Justices your Petitioner was again, that is to say on the Eighth day of December last, bound in Recognizance to appear at the present Sessions and answer the Complaint of the said Sarah Wallis And the said two Justices in the same Eighth day December last Determined or Ordered (but did not to your Petitioners Knowledge make any Order in Writing) that your Petitioner should

should in the mean time receive the said Sarah Wallis into his Family and Provide for her as his Apprentice by which said Determination or Order your Petitioner conceives himself to be aggrieved more especially as he has a Family of young Children and the said Sarah Wallis is by reason of her present Pregnancy with or Child or Children likely to be born or Bastard or Bastards in a State which renders it both scandalous and dangerous to Keep her in or Family where there are Young persons

Your Petitioner therefore humbly Appeals to this Court against the said Determination or Order of the said two Justices And Prays that your Worships will be pleased to appoint a day for the hearing and determining the said Appeal

And Your Petitioner will Pray Etc

John Buckingham
