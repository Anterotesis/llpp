P pound upon the Rents of the houses & lands in the said parish without any regard to the Ability of the person or to the great losses that often happen to the Occupiers of Lands in the said parish which is an unusual way and contrary to the method & custom there used & practiced is very unequal & oppressive to your Peticonr & other Occupiers of Land in the said parish as yor. Petr. humbly concieve And that several houses & Lands which ought to be assessed are wholly omitted out of the said Rate and many of the said Inhabitants are under rated in the said Rate in respect to their Abilities the Rich thereby excused and the Poor oppressed and many persons are rated in the said Rate for more Rent than they actually pay And that most of the houses in the said parish consist in small Rents & very few Â£15. P Ann And that many persons inhabiting in houses of 30. & 40 still P Ann are now rated & assessed which were never rated before by reason of their poverty & to prevent their gaining Settlements & becoming chargeable to the said parish. That many Inhabitants of great Substance live in houses of small Rents are charged only according to the Rent they pay & not according to their Ability And divers of the Appellts who have but small Substance & large families are forced to hold great Farms for the maintenance & Support of themselves & families & do often meet with great losses and are at great expence labour & pains in raising of their Rents & are by this Rate much over rated & oppressed That the former & antient method used in making a Discretionary Rate upon the Inhabitants of the said parish is much more equal than a pound rate.
