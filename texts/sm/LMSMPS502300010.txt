But the said Mackeris instead of serving your petr. or regarding his promises did make Interest and obtain the employment for himself Telling your Petr. Self Interest guided all Men And doth (tho' a Man of very good Substance and Estate) continue to Convey the Vagrants by persons hired for that purpose, being above doing the Duty himselfe and doth receive from this County for his trouble & expences the Salary of Sixty pounds per Annu.

That Your Petr. by the Order of the High Constable of Endfield hath at his own Costs & Charges Conveyed severall Vagrants, And still doth keep a Horse for that purpose: And can perform that Service cheaper than the same is now done.

That Your Petr. is desirous and willing to Maintain the great Charge of his Family by his Labour & Diligence And verily beleives he might have succeeded the said John Hewett had he not relyed on the said Mackeris's promise of Solliciting for him.

Your petr. therefore most humbly prays the direction of this Court, And that the said Mackeris may be debarred from Acting And that Your Petr. may be appointed by this Court to pass the said Vagrants

And Your Petr. (as in duty bound) shall ever pray Etc.
