The Humble Petition of James Riley Officer to the Sheriff of Middlesex.

Sheweth That Your Petitioner was on the Monday and Tuesday in this Present Session fined by your Worships for non Attendance

That your Petitioner has duly Attended at the Session ever Since and faithfully Promises to do so for the Future

Yr Petitioner therefore most humbly Suplicates Your Worships to take off the said Times

And as in duty Bound he will for ever Pray James Riley
