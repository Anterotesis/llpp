To the Right Worshipful His Majesties Justices of the Peace for the County of Middlesex in their present General Quarter Sessions of the Peace Assembled

The humble Petition of Joshua Walker Keeper of New Prison at Clerkenwell in the said County

Sheweth That your Petr: on Saturday last was served with an Order of this Honble Court for the payment of £20. due at Lady day 1727 as Keeper of the said Prison on Accot: of repairing the same and also the like sume of £20. due at Ladyday 1728. upon the like Accot: to Barwell Smith Esqr: on or before the first day of this present General Quarter Sessions of the Peace.

That your Petr: on his first Entrance on his said Office had the Keeping of such prisoners as were Comitted to his Custody for Felony or suspition of Felony (unless Indicted) so that Your Petr: did then receive their Fees But by an Order of Court since made at the Old Baily London Your Petr: hath been obliged to deliver such Prisoners to- gether with the Copies of thir Comitments to the Keeper of Newgate six days at least before every Sessions whereby Your Petr: intirely loses their Fees to his great detriment and is at the Trouble & Charge of keeping & maintaining most of them besides the Care & Trouble of conveying them to Newgate

That Your Petr: hath for near two Years past had but few other kind of Prisoners comitted & brought to his Custody & most of them poor indigent persons whose Fees he not only loses but must maintain them (and often times smal Children brought with them) during their Confinement In somuch that Your Petr: doth not receive by the profitts arriseing or accrew- ing to him by vertue of his said Office so much as pays the necessary charge of House keeping maintaining servants & the poor Prisoners, paying for the Water & smal repairs finding comon necessaries, carrying the Dirt away and other incident Charges belonging to the said prison (the Truth whereof Your Petr: is ready to Testifye upon Oath if required) All which renders Your Petr: uncapable of paying the Yearly Sumes of £20. & £10. charged on Your Petr: on his first Entrance of the said Office.

Therefore Your Petr: most humbly prays Your Worships will be pleased to take the premisses into Your Considerations & grant him such relief as to Your Worships in your great Goodness & Clemency shal seem meet.

And Your Petr: shall ever Pray & Joshua: Walker.
