To the Worshipful William Mainwaring Esqr. and the rest of His Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the County of Middlesex in their General Quarter Session Assembled

The Humble Representation of Henry Adams, Contractor for Conveying Vagrants Etc in respect to the charges against him contained in an Order of Court of the 16th Janury last

Unaccustomed to speak in Public, Henry adams begs to be permitted to represent in this Manner to your Worships the following Facts & observations,

He succeeded to the aforesaid Employment or the death of his Father in April Session 1774 since which he has had under his care for removal upwards of fourteen thousand Paupers, Mon, Women, and Children, and never incurred any consure worth December Session Session cash when a complaint was preferred against him relative to Sarah Baylis a Vagrant who dyed on the road as she was removing from Islington to Denham in Bucks

He Humbly represents that in the course of such a lenght of time among so great a Number of Paupers, Many of which must have been, and were, in their last Sickness, it cannot ( he thinks ) be matter of such wonder if not withstanding every possible exertion of care and humanity on his part four of these unhappy people should have dyed on the road This has been the Fact: But as he was wholly unconscious that other of these accident was owing to his want of Care or humanity, he never apprehended that any charge would, on any such occasion have over been brought against him.

As to the accusation respecting Sarah Baylis, he door not think he can in Decency enter again into the Merits of that charge as the Court have already decided thereon: But in respect to the Place appropriated for the reception of Vagrants at Enfield He can only inform Your Worships It is a House which belongs to Persons who have been instrusted with the reception and care of the Vargrants that have been brought that road for upward of twenty five Year and without any Compliant that over he heard of But having inspected the

Place some time since he found that the back door of the Room in which the Paupers usually lay was worn at the Cotton and immediately directed that cause of Complaint to be remedied which has been accordingly done

Sarah Roger the Mistress of the House at Enfield will give such Information to the Court respecting the charge concerning the Vargrant under a Mortification in his [---] as Henry Adams hopes will intirely exculpate him from that charge

And as to the charges concerning the Female Vargrant who dyed in the Pass cart in her Conveyance to Enfield Henry adams must refer himself to the Information which were taken before the Coroner and such explanatory avidance as will be given to your Worships by his late Servant William Rogers.

Henry Adams as to any charges whatsoever of inattention to the Health and Safety of the unhappy people who have been under his care begs leave to refer to the evidence of Mr Poyner late of Islington and now of great Mailborough street apothecary to whom Henry Adams has often applied for assistance for such Vagrants and who has frequently had the goodness to attend and administer gratis to them, and Henry adams also ( under this Head ) begs leave to refer to his Bills delivered in this Court in which will be found several articles for Medicines Etc which he Paid for from time to time on account of Paupers under his Conveyance

Margaret Moore (if thought necessary) will give evidence on the behalf of Henry Adams of Particular instances of Kindness and humanity shown to her Husband a Vagrant under his care,and who dyed at his House at Islington

Henry Adams's unremitting attention to the business of the County since last Session) having since then removed upwards of 380 paupers) has prevented him from paying those personal respects to Your Worships which he had determined to do on receiving Notice of the said

Order; insomuch that he now stands before your Worships interely unsupported except by his own Innocence and by the Candour and Justices of your Worships whereon he most firmly relies.
