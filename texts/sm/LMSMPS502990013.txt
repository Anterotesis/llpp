The humble petition of Several Butchers whose names are hereunto Subscribed.

Humbly Sheweth That your Petitioners with many others of the Same business living in or near London have for Several years past entered into agreements together in order to Present and Suppress the open and publick prophanation of the Lord day by divers Persons of the Same trade in selling and exposing of [...] ca [...] to Sale on that day to great dishonour of God, the Contempt of Religion and defyance of the Laws made for the Strict Observance of the Lords day.

That altho your petitioners have used their almost endeavours to prevent such Practices and for that purpose have expended Several Sums of money to detect Prosecute and convict those who have been and are Still guilty of such Crimes Yet all their endeavours have hitherto Proved ineffectual to Suppress the Same.

That your petitioners humbly conceive that thro' the neglect of Several officers in not detecting Such Sabbath breakers, and for that No Indictment prosecution as Your Petitioners Are Advised can be Supported for Such officers but only a for feiture of the goods, So Sold upon Conviction the perpetrators of Such Crimes Still Continue Comitting the same without remorse

Your Petitioners therefore most humbly pray that your Worships Will be Pleased to take this into Consideration and give Some Direction For the Suppressing of that Sunday Market in Turnmil Street and other Places and that the peace officers May being Such offenders to Justice both there and in other places where they Shall be Found offending in the manner above mentioned
