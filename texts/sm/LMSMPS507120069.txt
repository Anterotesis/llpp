To the worshipful Sa. John Hawkins Knt. & the rest of his Majesty's Justices assigned to keep the Peace in & for the County of Middlesex.

The humble Petition of William Brooks of the Parish of St. George Hanover Square in the said County of Middlesex.

Sheweth That the Churchwardens & Overseers of the said Parish of Saint George Hanover Square in a certain rate by them made for the a chief of the Poor of the said Parish have assessed your Petitioner for and on account of his new erected Dwelling House in Saint James Street within the said Parish upon a Rent of £ 500 p Annurn

That your Petr. hath not any Stable Coach house or other Outbuilding whatever belonging to the said Dwelling House

That your Petr. is informed that the said Churchwardens & Overseers have assessed your Petitioner upon the sd. Seem of £500 P Anmum by reason of its having been represented to them that the erecting of your Petrs. said House amounted of an expence of £10,000 at the the same in fact did not amount to that Sum

That there are within the said Parish several very magnificent Houses (the building whereof very considerably exceeded in point of expence your Petrs. said (House) which are rated at no more than the Sum of £300 p Annum particularly the Houses of his Grace the Dake of Devonshire & the Earls of Shelburne & Chesterfield

That the Rule for Assessing Houses within the said Parish is at the rate of two thirds of the real annual value so that your Petr. according to that, proportion is rated upon a rent of £750 P Annum.

That your Petr. in consequence of such unequal assessment conceives himself aggrieved by the said rate & therefore humbly prays your worships to amend the same so far as relates to your Petr. & to award him his Costs touching the making of this appeal

And your Petr shall ever pray
