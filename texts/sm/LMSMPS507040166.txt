Your Petitioners therefore humbly prays that your Worships would be pleased to Order the benefit of the said Appeal to be saved to your Petitioners; and that your Worships would be pleased to appoint a day in the next general Quarter Session of the Peace to hear and determine the said Appeal; and at the same time that the Churchwardens and Overseers of the said Parish may produce the Books of the Old Rates for the Relief of the Poor of the said Parish as also the Books of the present Rates. And that your Worships would be pleased to make such order therein as to your Worships shall seem meet

And your Petitioners shall ever Pray
