Whereas Idleness being generally the introduction of unhappy Peoples misfortunes, It is therefore most humbly presented to your Honours (if I may be So happy as to Succeed) to employ such unhappy Persons (as shall or may be Committed) in Picking for Teasing) Carding, and Spinning of Wool, for the Making of Blankets, Ruggs Etc. And as there is great Numbers Committed Yearly this Manufactory in Time may become the greatest in the Kingdom for many after being discharged will be glad to be employed at their own Houses Etc.
