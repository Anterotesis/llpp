That, by an Act of Parliament made in the seventh Year of his late Majesty King George Your Royal Predecessor of Glorious Memory, Intilled an Act for the Regulation of Journeymen Taylors within the Weekly Bills of Mortality It is amongst other Things enacted

That, no Contract shall be made between Masters and Journeymen for raising their Wages or lessning their usual Hours of Labour, as is in the said Act expresly stipulated, under certain Penalties therein directed with full Power vested in the Justices in Quarter Sessions assembled to vary the Directions of the said Act occasionally And to punish Offenders against the same, or against any consequent Order of such Quarter Sessions.

That the Journeymen Taylors having refused to comply or work for the Masters on the Terms of the said Act, The Master Taylors were necessitated to apply for Relief to the Justices in Quarter Sessions, as is by the said Act directed, who on the Eleventh Day of July last on hearing Councill on both Sides, came to several Resolutions, and made an Order thereupon as then seemed to their mutual Satisfaction, And for which the said Journeymen Taylors returned them Thanks in the Publick News Papers as in and by the said Order and Publication hereunto will more amply appear.

That from the 25th. Day of March to the 29th. day of September the said Journeymen very readily complyed with the Terms of the said Order, But since that Time have refused and still do refuse to work for the Wages Stipulated thereby.

That on the Contrary, and in Defiance of the said Act of Parliament, The Powers thereof, And of the said Order, by mutual Consent made, They or a large Body of them, have entred into a Combination, not only, not to work for the said Stipulated Wages, but also by Force and Violence to deterr others who were willing to comply with the said Order, likewise from working And as a further Breach of the said Order, and in Violation and Contempt of the said Act have sent Letters

Letters to several Master Taylors therein threatning to blow act their Brains and fire their Houses in Case they should not comply with their Illegal Demands And agree to pay the Wages by themselves the said combined Journeymen demanded in direct Contravention and Contempt of the said Act and Order And of other the Laws in Force against Combinations, threatning Letters and such like Violence, putting several of your Majestys faithfull and loyall Subjects in Fear of their Lives and personally assaulting beating and abusing others To the great Terror of your Majestys said faithfull and loyall Subjects, To the utter Subversion of Peace and good Government. and of the Course and Transaction of that Branch of Business, The setting thereby of evil Example to the Labourers in other lawfull Avocations and Professions and the Encouragement of Riots and Illegal Assemblies.

Your Petitioners Therefore most humbly Pray. That your Majesty would be most Graciously pleased by your Order in Councill, by Proclamation or otherwise to enforce the Laws by directing the Suppression of all such Illegal Combinations, Threatnings and Violence And if it so please Your Majesty to ofter an adequate Reward, for the Discovery and Punishment of such notorious Offenders against the Laws or in such other Manner to remedy the Complaint of your Majesty's most faithfull peaceable and loyal Subjects as to your Majesty's most Gracious Wisdom shall be found Necessary and expedient.
