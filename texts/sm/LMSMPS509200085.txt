To the Worshipful His Majesty's Justices assembled at the [---] General Sessions of the Peace begun and holden the 30th: day of November 1795 in and for the County of Middlesex

The humble Petition of William Chamberlayne of Aylesbury Street in the Parish of St. James Clerkenwell in the said County Surgeon & Apothecary.

Sheweth That on or about the 7th: day of September 1793 Thomas Hadley Swain (Son of the Reverend John Hadley Swain of East Street Red Lion Square Clerk) was bound Apprentice to your Petr.

That the said Apprentice instead of demeaning and conducting himself to your Petr. and to his Patients, and to his Business according to the Duties of his Station, has neglected the Shop and Business of your Petitioner, denied your Petitioner when at home unto his Patients; Refused to tell where your Petitioner was to be found when he well knew it; Whereby your Petitioner lost the Opportunity and Emoluments of being present at One Labour (if not more) and has Otherwise been greatly Inferred in his Practice.

That besides behaving with Rudeness to the Patients of your Petitioner the said Apprentice has sometimes neglected [---] to make up Medicines when directed, and at Others made them up contrary to the directions given, and at Others put false Labels to the Medicines made up which Conduct hath occasioned great Confusion, and hath done irreperable Injury to your Petitioners

That the said Apprentice when spoken to by your Petitioner on such Transactions Instead of shewing Contrition, or Promising Amendment, hath treated your Petitioner with most Illiberal Abuse and declared that he would Continue to Injure your Petitioner in his Practise, and would put One Shilling an hour out of his Pocket; and that he would render the Lises of your Petr. and his Wife Uncomfortable Etc.

That the said Apprentice (in a Letter to One of his Acquaintance) hath threatned to practise upon your Petitioner "a dark and severe Revenge"- Insomuch that your Petitioner conceives not only his Property but his Life to be in danger from the Malicious Disposition of his Apprentice.

Your Petitioner therefore humbly hopes that your Worships (having taken the Premises into Consideration) will be pleased to Order that the said Apprentice of your Petitioner may be discharged.

And your Petitioner shall Ever pray Etc
