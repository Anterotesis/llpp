To the Worshipful the Chairman and the rest of the Justices. [...] bled at their Sessions non holden at Hicks's Hall [...] at John Street for the County of Middlesex

The humble Petition of George Blackiston of King Street in the Parish of Saint Paul, Covent Garden, Grocer.

Sheweth, That one Edward Lloyd who was bound Apprentice to yor: Petr: by the Overseers of the poor of the Liberty of the Rolls in the County of Middx And , who is often intrusted, to take Money from yor Petrs: Customers, has several times been guilty of Embezzeling the same by which Your Petitioner's Loss (as he apprehends) must be very considerable, in some of which he has been detected.

That as such an Apprentice is unfit for any Business, he is the more so for his, as Money must of Course Frequently pass through his Hands, which of dishonestly detained, the Master must be inevitably and insensibly ruined.

That lately his said Apprentice has absconded, from his Service thro' a Consciousness of his Guilt, and a Fear of the Punishment which such Guilt deserves.

That in under Compassion to his Youth, he is unwilling to send him abroad, as it wou'd be an indelible Stain on his Character, and might deprive him perhaps of every honest method of getting his Livelyhood for the future.

Your Petitioner therefore most humbly prays Your Honourable Bench to take his Case into Consideration, and that you wou'd be pleased to discharge him of his said Apprentice, who is so much inclined and has it so much in his Power to do him irretrievable Injuries.

Most humbly Submitted Etc Geo; Blackiston
