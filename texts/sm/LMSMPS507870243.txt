He took said Garden Ground five Years ago, which was then as can be well attented by several creditable Inhabitants in & out of the Parish, in a very bad Condition, but his laying out upon it more than thirty pounds in ready Money, besides thro' indefaligable Labor & Industry brought it to bear as it now does; & was in Hopes of reaping after so many Years Labor & Expence the Fruits of his Hand which however are now frustrated by your Worships haveing fin'd on that Spot to be built upon.

P. J. C.

If during the Time of your Worships being in Treaty about the said Premises your Petitioner has by any means displeased you, he is most heartily sorry for it & intreats your Pardon, promising to conform himself infuture intirely to your Worships Command

He has now for these last twelve Months past been seeking in vain for another Ground, but haveing now found one uncultivated, the Proprietor will let him have it on a Lease provided your Petitioner will built a Hut upon it for his Habitation, but having spind his Prop [...] the Quaker Ground & being de [...] means to do it, once more most humbly intreats your Worships most gracious & kind Donnation, which he will most thankfully receive & as in Duty bound ever pray

Your Worships most obedient & most duty full Servant Edward Hartwright
