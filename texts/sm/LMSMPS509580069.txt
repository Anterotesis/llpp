That about Twelve months ago the said John Hall took a Public House in Parkers Lane Saint Giles's where he lodged your Petitioner in a Garret with four Beds and where any Person who came for a Nights Lodging might and did sleep in consequence of which your Petitioner found Vermin upon his Body and Linen
