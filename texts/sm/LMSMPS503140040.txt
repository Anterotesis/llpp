To the Right Worshipfull his Majesty's Justices of the peace in Quarter Sessions Assembled

The Humble Petition and appeal of Guise Hall and Tho. Hill Esqrs. Humphrey Ambler Reginald Heber and Edward Benton Gentlemen on behalf of themselves and the rest of the gentlemen Inhabiting within the Liberty of the Rolls

Sheweth That Severall Gentlemen Trademen and the overseers of the Poor Inhabiting within the said Liberty met on Midsumer Day last in order to make a proper and Equal rate for the Maintenance of the Poor and an Equal Rate was accordingly have at one Shilling in the Pound according to the Rent of Each Inhabitants House and was Signed by Severall Inhabitants and the said overseers and Carryed to the House of one of his Majesties Justices of the Peace resideing within the said Liberty to be confirmed

That the Said overseers took away the Said Rate before the Justice had Leajure to peruse it and at another meeting amongst the Tradesmen without acquainting any of the Gentlemen they made another Rate and thereby Assessed themselves at Eight pence and the Gentlemen at Twelve pence in the Pound and Carryed the Said New Rate to two Justices of the Peace Distant from the said Liberty and Concealed from them the Equal Rate which had been made and instead thereof Shewed them a Rate made by the Tradesmen the year before which agreed with that then made and thereby and on pretence that there were no Justices of the Peace within the said Liberty prevailed with the said Justices without the Liberty to Sign the same.

That the said Rate so made and Signed as aforesaid is a Partial arbitrary and unequal Rate that Sr. Joseph aylife and Mr. Griffin who were two Justices resideing within the Liberty were Generally therein two or three Days in a week and the Concealing of the Said equal Rate and the Reasons given for Confirming the other were Impotsitions on the said Justices

Your Petrs therefore humbly appeal agt. the said Rate so Confirmed and pray the said overseers may attend your worshipps and produce both the said Rates and that the said unequal Rate may be set aside
