To the Worshipfull Wm. Cowper Esqr. Chairman of the Sessions at Hicks's hall & to the rest of the Justices there

The humble Petition & Appeal of John Crewe Esqr

Sheweth That your Peticoner was about six years agoe Rated or assessed to the Scavingr. for his house in Queenes Square in the parish of St. George the Martyr in the County of Middx the sum of Twenty shillings & noe more, & your Petrs is advised that was as much as he could be Justly rated or ought to pay to the Scavingrs. for his sd. house

That for the last year (1729) your Petitionr was assessed or Rated to pay to the said Scavingrs for his said house the sume of £2:4s:8d. which rate (in the title of itt) is called a Rate of four pence half penny in the pound by the rents of the houses

That for several years & untill the last year Your Peticoners said house was assessed to the Land tax at £80. P ann Out for the last year at One hundred pounds p ann And therefore £2:4s:8d. at four pence half penny in the pound is an Overcharge of seven shillings & [...] peace £100. at 4½ in the pound amounting at to £1:17s:6d

That several of the Inhabitants of the said Parish are rated as high as your Peticonrs. to the Land tax but are not soe to the Scavingrs. which your Peticonr humbly insists is both unequal & unreasonable, the Vallue of houses as stated in the Kings books being the measure by which the other Rates or Assessmts. should be made & ought to be governed

For which reasons your Peticonr appeals from ye sd. Assessmt. to yor. Worships & prays that a day may be appointed for hearing thereof & that yr. Peticonr may have such relief as to yr. Worships shall seem meet
