been allowed and they humbly insist that the same ought now to be disallowed

Your Petitioners therefore appeal against the said account, so made up and allowed as aforesaid, to this honorable Court and most humbly pray That the several Sums herein before mentioned may be disallowed And that this Court will be pleased to disallow the same accordingly And that this Court will also be pleased to order that the amount of the Monies, so to be disallowed may be paid, by the Treasurer or Treasurers, nominated by Virtue of the said act for the Receipt of all monies applicable to the Relief of the Poor of the said Parish, either to your Petitioners for the benefit of themselves and such other of the Inhabitants of the said Parish from whom the Rates and Assessments for the Relief of the Poor of the said Parish for the Year 1785 have been collected or that such Monies may be accounted for by such Treasurer or Treasurers and be paid and applied for the Relief of the Poor of the said Parish or that this Court will be pleased to make such other Order in the Premises as shall be Just
