That Soon after an Act of Parliament passed by which the Punishment of Convicts sentenced to Transportation, was changed to that of Imprisonment, in Consequence of which your Petitioner has had not only the Care of those he was first appointed to attend but also of all those who from Session to Session have been sentenced to Imprisonment in the said Jails; Many of whom come in
