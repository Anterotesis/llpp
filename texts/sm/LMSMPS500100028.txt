To ye Worll Bench of Justices for the County of Middx Etc

The humble Peticon of Richard Slater and John Whalett late Scavengers for Nortonfalgate Liberty

Sheweth That by the Removal of some and the Death & Poverty of Other Inhabitants of the said Liberty and alsoe by the Refusal of many to pay what was assessed upon them The Rate which was [...] Delivered to your Petionrs will not by new [...] [---] Pounds amount to the Sume that is agreed to give the Raker for keeping the Streets clean: Yor Peticonrs therefore some daies since desired some of the Ancient Inhabitants of the said Liberty to meet, in Order to make a new Rate whereby yor Petionr might be [...] relieved, But were answered by the Inhabitants that they thought it not safe soe to doe, without an Order from this Worll Bench

Yor Petionr therefore humbly pray this Worth Bench to grane them an Order to Summon together the Inhabitants of the said Liberty, to make such a Rate as that yor Petionr may not Lose both their Time & Money: which yor Petionr humbly conceive to be unreasonable.

And yor Petionr Shall ever pray Etc.
