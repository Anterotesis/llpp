To William Mainwaring Esqr.

The humble Petition of John Eddy.

Sheweth That Your Petitioner was tried on Tuesday last before your Worship on a Bill of Indictment preferred against him for an Assault by one Abraham Attwell - It is not your Petitioner's Design to even Attempts to Question the Judgment of Court or Jury in finding him Guilty but thinks his Case hard in being kept under Confinement after the Sum of Twenty five pounds has been preferred which is the Moiety of the Fine levied over since the Evening on which the Gentlemen of the Jury found him Guilty and that merely under the Colour of Exerting seven additional Pounds as further Expences. Your Petitioners therefore humbly begs your Worship will take his Case into Consideration and Order him to be released from his Confinement on Payment of the Sum of Twenty five Pounds

And Your Petitioner as in Duty bound Shall ever Pray Etc

NB. The Former Attorney for the Prosecution is now under Confinement and a second Attorney comes forward and Demands Â£12. Costs and threatens to bring an Action for More Extensive Costs alluding that the worthy Chairman as conceived at a fine which he calls a small one which the Defendant is very ill able to pay the Moiety or one half part of
