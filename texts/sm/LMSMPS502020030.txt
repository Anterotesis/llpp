Sheweth That the Liberty of the Dutchy of Lancaster in the said County for a Great many Years last past had a convenient Watch House in the strand near somersett House which stood upon part of the Ground where the New Church now stands and by the Commissioners was ordered to be pulled down.

That since the said Watch House was pulled downe the Constables were for sometime obliged to keep their Watch House in the Church House of the Parish of St. Clements Danes in the said Liberty for distant from the place were Comitted in the Streets; and for some time past the irregularityes were Comitted in the Streets; and for some time past the Constables of the said Liberty have been obliged to keep their Watch in the Round House in Strand Lane in the said Liberty farr out of the hearing of any Noise or publick Clamours in the Streets.

That lately James Brett Esquire Secretary to his Grace the Duke of Portland was Robbed and Barberously Wounded near Somersett house and had the Watch house been in the place where it formerly stood or had the Constables been in the hearing of the Noise in the publick Streets the same might probably have been prevented.
