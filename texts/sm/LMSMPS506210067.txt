Sheweth That one John Collins Son of Luke Collins Labour the Third day of July one Thomas seven Hundred and Seventy-by and with the Coran [...] of his Father did place himself Apprentice to yours Petitioner to born his Art and with him after the Manner of an Apprentice to serve from the day of the date thereof for the Term of Seven Years and Your Petitioner in Consideration of the Sum of Fifteen Pounds his said Apprentice in the Art of a Cooper which he used by the best meand that he could should Teach and Instruct or Cause to be taught and Instructed and find him Meat Drink Lodging and Necessaries

That the said Apprentice hath at Various Times greatly Misbehaved himself in your Petitioners Service by frequenting Alehouses getting Drunk and Absenting himself from your Petitioners Service not only without his Convent but contrary to your Petitioners Commands for many Hours together sometimes whole Days and sometimes all Might and for disorderly behaviour and neglect of Duty and disobedience to your Petitioners Commands when in his Service insomuch that your Petitioner is apprehensive that his Behaviour and Example will Corrupt the rest of Your Petitioners Apprentices who are six in Number.

That from the disorderly Behaviour of the said apprentice yours Petitioner was Obliged to and did take him before a Magistrate who severely reprimanded him and would have Committed him to Prison but being the first time of the Youths being before a Justice did on his Promising Amendment for the future discharge him

That the said Apprentice soon relapsed into his former Course of Behaviour and grew if Posible more disobedient so that your Peittioner was again Obliged to have him before two Magistrates who on hearing Your Petitioners Complaint committed the said John Collins to Bridewell for a Month

That the Mother of the said Apprentice hearing her Son was committed came and earnestly Entreated and requested your Petitioner to Procure his discharge and your Petitioner being induced to think the Committners would have had some in influenced in reclaiming this Youth as he then shew'd some sign of Ropentance by making four Promises of Amendment Procured his Discharge on the fourth day after his Commitment, but instead of making a greatful return for Your Petitioners lenity he no sooner finds himself at Liberty but Lanuches out Perito the same Couse of Behaviour And instead of the least Appearance of Amendment he

Appears improved in wickedness and continues the same disorderly and ungovernable

That your Petitioner has been informed that Luke Collins the Father gives Countonanas to his Son the said Apprentice in his Disobedience and Doubbs not to prove that the said Luke Collins threatened that he would send Freemen and that he himself would be one, And that they would do for yours Petitioner meaning as your Petitioner Apprehends to do him some bodily harm

That from the repeated Misbehaviour of the said Apprentice and the Threats of his Father Your Petitioner is not only under fears and Apprehensions for the safety of himself and Family but in Danger of loosing the benefit of the rest of his Apprentices by the bad Example set them by this

That Your petitioner at the Quarter Session held at Hicks Hall by Adjournment on Friday the Fifth day of July last presented a Petition to the purpart and Effect above set forth when it was Ordered that the said John Collins should have Notice thereof and that he and all Persons concerned should attend the Court on Saturday then next to hear and abide the Judgment and determination of the said Court touching the said Petition

That your Petitioner the said John Collins and other Persons concerned Accordingly Attended the Court in Order to hear the Petition but same not coming on it was Ordered to stand over till the then next Sessions

That your Petitioner according attended such next Sessions in September last but he and his Council not being early enough in the Morning when the same was Called on, the Petition for that reason and no other was dismissed

That the said John Collins the apprentice during the time the said Petition continued undetermined and since the same was dismissed has continued disobedient and refractory and not in the least attended to the lawful Commands of Your Petition but on the Contrary hath Committed several Irregularities particularly by staying out at Nights and coming home at unseasonable Hours Drunk, And by his Conduct seems to set Your Petitioner at defiance

Your Petitioner therefore Prays Your
