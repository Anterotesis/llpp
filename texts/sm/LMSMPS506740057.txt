To the Worshipful Sir John Hawkins Knight and the rest of His Majestys Justices of the Peace in and for the County of Middlesex in General Session of the Peace Assembled.

The Humble Memorial and Representation of the Constable and Headboroughs of the Parish of Christ Church in the County of Middlesex whose Names are hereto Subscribed on behalf of themselves and other the Inhabitants of the said Parish

Sheweth That Your Memoralists having been duly Sworn into their respective Offices at a Court Leet holden for Manor of Stepney they have according to the best of their Ability executed the same, And particularly have been Active and Vigilant in the executing of General Privy Search Warrants for the said Parish, and in the Apprehending of Rogues Vagabonds and other idle and disorderly Persons within the said Parish pursuant to his Majestys Order in Council, and continued so to do, until the Obstructions hereinafter mentioned,

That James Penleaze Esquire One of His Majestys Justices of the Peace in and for the said County who resides in Hackney Road within the Parish of Saint Leonard Shoreditch comes daily to the dwelling House of Mr. George Penleaze his Son situate in Church Street Spitalfields and there executes his Office of a Justice of the Peace

That for the Purpose, (as Your Memoralists conceive) of having the several Persons taken by Virtue of the Justices Warrants, brought before him, he hath Swore in two Headboroughs, namely, Jonathan Waters a Victualler in Shoreditch, and Henry Britt, a Whitechapple Court Officer, living in Bethnal Green Parish, and also frequently

Specially appoints, Thomas Abbott (who is likewise a Whitechapple Court Officer) and James Thurgar (who is the Menial Servant of the said Justice in the Capacity of looking after his Horse, Cleaning his Knives, and Shoes, and such like employment) to execute his Warrant, which they accordingly do

That Your Memoralists are greatly Aggrieved, by these Sort of People being employed in manner above Set forth, inasmuch as they, under the Idea of being Peace Officers, frequently obstruct Your Memoralists, in the Execution of their Duty, and have taken some of the Peace Officers duly Sworn in at the Court Leet, and carried them before the said Justice Penleaze, under various idle pretences, And when Persons taken up by the Peace Officers, on a General Privy Search, have been discharged by the Magistrates, the said Justices pretended Officers have caused some of the Persons so discharged, to apply to the said Justice, for his Warrant against the Peace Officers duly appointed, for having so taken them up, which his Worship has accordingly granted;

That Your Memoralists humbly conceive that the Swearing in by the said Justice of the said Jonathan Waters (who was then and Still is a Victualler) is directly contrary to a Standing Order of Sessions contained in folio 15, of Your Worships Orders, And that not only the Swearing in of the said Jonathan Waters (who lives in another Parish) but also the Swearing in of the said Henry Britt by a Justice out of Sessions, is repugrant to Law, And the directing of Warrants Specially, to a White Chaple Court Officer, & likewise to a Menial Servant of the said Justice, affords great

Opportunitys of Hardship and Oppression, Several Persons having been oppressed by them, And particularly one Claude Jayot (a Housekeeper in Spitalfields) had his House broke and entred at eight o'Clock on Saturday Evening of the 22d. of August last by Several of the Justices Men (armed with Pistols and Cutlasses) and their Assistants (who if Possible are worse than themselves) when they well knew, the Justice was gone from his Office, And that the Party could not have a hearing, and therefore they took and carried the said Claude Jayot to Clerkenwell Prison, by way of Punishing him, where he lay till the Monday following, and was then carried before the said Justice Penleaze, on a dispute touching the Weaving a Piece of Mantua Silk

That Your Memoralists beg leave to Observe that if these things are permitted, the Inhabitants in and near Spitalfields, will not be free from the Ravages of these People, and Your Memoralists will be in danger of continual Law Suits, in executing their Office

Your Memoralists therefore with all Submission, presume to lay these Facts before You, And hope Your Worships will be pleased to take such Steps, as shall effectually prevent in future, this great abuse of Public Justice,

And Your Petitioners will ever pray
