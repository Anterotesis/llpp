To the Worshipfull his Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the County of Middlesex in their General Quarter Session of the Peace Assembled.

The Petition and Appeal of William Miles of the Hamlet of Pinner in the said County Esquire.

Sheweth That by virtue of a Rate or Assessment made for the relief of the Poor of the said Hamlet and for other Purposes mentioned in the several Acts of Parliament relating to the Poor on or about the ninth day of March last past and allowed by two of his Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the said County and afterwards Published in the Church of the said Hamlet your Petitioner is charged in and by such Rate or Assessment with a large and excessive Sum of Money for the purposes aforesaid and much more than according to the real Value of his Rateable Property within the said Hamlet he should be charged at and also much more in Proportion to such Value than several other Inhabitants and Occupiers of Rateable property within the said Hamlet and charged at.-

That the pretended Rule of charging Persons to the said Rate is at a Rack Rent or to the full amount of the Real annual Value of the rateable property which they respectively Occupy or Possess in the said Hamlet but which said rule the Persons who made the said Rate have departed from and disregarded in several instances and several Circumstances of inequality and Partiality in Charging Persons will appear upon inspecting the said Rate and enquiring into and ascertaining the Particulars of the real value of such property Particularly

That the Reverend Mr Williams Minister of the said Hamlet is charged or Assessed therein at no more than after the Rate of Forty five Pounds per Annum although his dwelling House and the Appurtenances thereunto belonging are much more valuable with respect to size Convenience and Situation than those of your Petitioner (which are rated as aftermentioned at Seventy Pounds per Annum) And in which said Charge or Assessment of Forty Five Pounds Per Annum is included a large Orchard and fourteen Acres of the best Land within the said Hamlet

That your Petitioner in the Year 1764 Purchased a House Cottage and Land in the said Hamlet the whole comprizing about Six Acres including the Rate of the House Cottage Garden and Yards which consisted of about two Acres of the said six Acres, and the said Cottage was worth about Five Pounds or six Pounds per Annum to be lett.

That the premises so purchased by your Petitioner being situated on a small Common called the Marsh and generally Flooded upon any Considerable fall of Rain the situation is objectionable in the opinion of many Renters of Houses and on that account the premises are considerably depreciated in point of value either to be lot or sold

That in the Year 1768 your Petitioner let the whole of the said Premises as the same were purchased by him to a Tenant for a Year at the annual rent of Thirty Pounds after having stood empty for several years and after such Tenant quitted them they remaned unoccupied a year, whereupon your Petitioner (being unable to find a purchaser for them or to lot them to any advantage) returned in the Year 1770 to reside on them himself, and being soon afterwards rated at Fifty Pounds a Year he attended a Petty Sessions of his Majestys Justices of the Peace holden at Edgeware and upon proof being made before them of the rent at which he had let the premises as aforesaid and other Circumstances respecting their Value being taken into Consideration the Overseers of the Poor Consented to rate him at Thirty Pounds per Annum But your Petitioner

afterwards adding to his Premises by the purchase of about one Acre and three Quarters of Land they were in Consequence thereof rated at Thirty three Pounds ten Shillings per Annum which rate he did not attempt to get reduced (although the beforementioned Cottage had been pulled down and the annual Value of his premises certained lessened thereby) and at this rate the Premises were regularly continued to be charged during a Course of Twenty Years.

That in the Year 1780 your Petitioner quitting the said Hamlet left the Premises to the care of a Friend with directions to let them ready Furnished only, at a rent of Thirty three Pounds Ten Shillings for the whole of the premises together (independant of the furniture) and also for such other annual Sum as could be obtained for the use of the furniture Fixtures Uttensils and Exotics with great variety of very good Flower roots.-

That in Consequence of your Petitioner's said direction and after the premises had remained unoccupied half a year they were Left upon Lease to Daniel Jones Esquire at Thirty three Pounds per annum for the House and premises and Thirty seven Pounds per Annum for the use of the Furniture Fixtures Utensils Exotics Etc left on the Premises.

That the said Daniel Jones Occupied the Premises Six Years and three Quarters and the Annual Sum of Thirty seven Pounds paid by him for the use of the furniture and other things left there by your Petitioner was for unequal to the expences and losses which your Petitioner sustained by the removal of such Parts of his Furniture as the said Tenant had no Occasion for, which said Expences and losses could not be made good to your Petitioner for less than Three hundred Pounds.

That the said Tenant quitted the Premises at Michaelmas 1787 and then your Petitioner advertized them to be lett or Sold, but from the ill Condition in which they they were left, and their Objectionable situation on the Marsh as aforesaid your Petitioner could neither Procure a Purchasor or Tenant and therefore in March 1788 he returned reside upon the said Premises and has ever since occupied the same himself having done such repairs thereto only as were absolutly necessary to make them tenantable.

That in a rate made for the Relief of the Poor of the said Hamlet on the fourth of August last your Petitioner's said Premises were raised from Thirty three Pounds Ten Shillings (at which they had continued during Twenty Years as aforesaid and which is the full Annual value thereof) to Forty Pounds per Annum And two Fields which your Petitioner Occupies besides his said Premises were at the same time raised from Seventeen Pounds to Twenty Pounds per Annum. And several other Persons who were Assessed in the last mentioned Rate being dissatisfied not only with the Charges made upon them therein but with the Partial and unequal manner in which others were charged, several plans were suggested for equallizing the Charges on the whole of the Rateabe property within the said Hamlet according to fair and reasonable Valuations thereof and among others one was suggested by your Petitioner of appointing at a full Vestry Meeting convened for the purpose a Committee of the most intelligent Inhabitants to settle a rule for and ascertain such equal valuation in order that the same might be fixed upon a fair and impartial Basis in future but this being objected to by some Persons who by influence carry all questions at the Public Meetings as they think proper and who are and have been themselves favoured by not being charged in the Rates to the amount of their Rateable property. several of them attended a Meeting of the Magistrates acting for the division holden on the Ninth of August last upon pretence of taking their advice upon a Plan for a more equal mode of rating and your Petitioner likewise attended the said Meeting and upon some conversation taking Place respecting the annual value of his Premises he produced the before mentioned Lease, whereby the were lett to the said Daniel Jones at Thirty three Pounds ten Shillings per Annum the Magistrates recommended to him to acquiesed in a Rental of Forty Pounds and seventeen Pounds per Annum for the Fields to which he consented and the Parish Officers then Appeared fully satisfied therewith but it appearing by such Lease that your Petitioner was to have Thirty seven Pounds Per Annum for the use of his Furniture Fixtures Uttensils Exotics Etc as before mentioned the Persons who made the succeeding Rate were determine

to take advantage of that Circumstance and on the Eighth of December last your Petitioner was charged therein at the Rate of Seventy Pounds per Annum for his said Premises and Seventeen Pounds per Annum for the said two Fields thereby charging him (as your Petitioner conceives) at the Rate of Thirty seven Pounds per Annum for the value of the furniture and other things before mentioned which he humbly apprehend are not rateable property.

That in and by the beforementioned Rate made on the Ninth day of March last (being the same which your Petitioner now Appeals against) your Petitioner is also charged according to the said Annual value of Seventy Pounds per Annum for and in respect of his said first mentioned Premises (over and above the Charge of Seventeen Pounds per Annum for the said two Fields) which said Charge at the Rate of Seventy Pounds per Annum your Petitioner conceives to be exorbitant unreasonable and excessive and that the principal part thereof is made in contemplation of a kind of property (such as Furniture Etc as beforementioned) which is not chargeable by Law to the relief of the Poor in Places where there is no Custom for Charging such property and as there has never been such a Custom in the said Hamlet nor any Person therein ever charged in respect to the like Kind of Property your Petitioner conceives himself agrieved by the last mentioned Rate or Assessment.

Your Petitioner therefore finding himself aggrieved by the said Partial and unequal Rate made on the Ninth day of March last as beforementioned and by the excessive and unreasonable Charge made upon him therein and by the Conduct of the said Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor on making the said Rate Doth hereby Appeal to your Worships against the same And requests that you will be Pleased to appoint a day for the hearing and determining the said Appeal And that you will thereupon Quash and set aside the said lastmentioned rate or Assessment made for the relief of the Poor as aforesaid And Order and direct that the Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor of the said Hamlet may make another Rate with equality and indifference according or in proportion to the real and true Value of all and every Part of the property rateable to the relief of the Poor of the said Hamlet or that you will be pleased to alter and amend the said last= =mentioned Rate and reduce the rent Charge upon your Petitioner to Thirty Three Pounds ten Shillings as it formerly stood or otherwise grant your Petitioner such Relief in the Premises as to you shall seem meet.

And Your Petitioner will pray Etc William Miles
