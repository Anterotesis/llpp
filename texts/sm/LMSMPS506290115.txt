The humble Petition of the Commissioners for paving Repairing Cleansing Draining Lighting and Watching that part of the parish of Saint Sepulchre that is and lieth in the County of Middlesex and for removing Annoyances and Obstructions therefrom and preventing the like for the future Etc

Sheweth

That your Petitioners in pursuance of an Act Parliament lately made and passed are cause in [...] and Carriage ways within the same to be new paved a [...] otherwise improved at a very considerable expence to the Inhabitants thereof for the benefit and accomodation of the publick in general

That the present Watch House situate in the center of St John Street near Smithfield Bars is not only a every great Nuisance of itself and a harbour for all manner of Filth and Rubbish but also unfit for the purpose being to small to hold above five persons at most and without any place whatever for securing disorderly persons in that may be apprehended or given in Charge to the Constable or Headborough of the Night who are obliged to send them to Prison until they can be carried before a Majestrate the next day

That for these reasons and as it will tend to the greater improvement of that part of the parish if the said Watch House was pulled down and entirely removed and a more convenient one erected and built in some other part of the parish as well for the better accommodation of the Officers of the Night as for the securing (without Sending to Prison) until they can be carried before a Majestrate all such persons as may be apprehended or given in Charge as aforesaid But for as much as there is no suitable and proper place within the said part of the Parish for that purpose except on the West side of the Wall of the Court Yard of Hicks's Hall where the Engine House how stands (or even there without making use of the said Wall) and your Petitioners are desirous of erecting a Building there according to the plan hereunto annexed to answer the purpose as well of a Watch House as an Engine House which may be of great use in cases of Fire in the Night time by having people always at hand to give timely assistance of the Engine

Your Petitioners therefore most humbly pray your Worships that in erecting such Building for the purpose of a Watch House and Engine House where the Engine House now stands according to the said plan they may beat liberty to make use of so much of the Wale of the said Court Yard as may be necessary And your Petitioners shall ever pray Etc
