The humble Peticon of John Goff

Humbly Sheweth That on Wednesday Night last your Peticoner was by the Worshippfull Justice Ward comitted to New Prison in this County for being concerned with others in causing a disturbance in the Streete And that at a Goal delivery this Morning your Petitr: was by this Court sent to the house of Correction there to remaine for the space of Fourteen daies.

That your Petitr: was Innocently Drawn into the sd. Fact and is heartily sorry for the same And forasmuch as your peticoners wife lying now in a sick and weak condition and having noe body to Subsist her or provide for her your petitr: confinement would not only tend to his utter ruin but the loss of his Wife.

Yor. Petitr: therefore humbly prays yor. Worshipps will be pleased to order that he may be Discharged from his said Imprisonment

And yor Petr shall ever pray Etc John Goff
