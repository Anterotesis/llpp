I was bought up in the Charity School of St. Clemons Danes, and Afterwards in Sepr. 1720. was bound an Apprentice att the Goynt Charge of the Said parish and the Society to which I belonged to Walter Chaloner who a Year afterward gave five pound with me and two suits of verry good Apparel to Mr. Wm. Will's a Vittler now Living att the Sign of the Pyed Bull in Graysinn Lane who takes no Care of me nor Shew any Concern for me so yt. I am almost in a naked Condition and ever reduced to Clean Shoes in ye. Street for a maintenance out of the Little I gain, That way I Can but Just Keep my self and pay, for my Lodgings but Considering how Young I am and the many Temptections which Attend that Life I humbly pray Your Worship's to take my unhappy Case to a Consideration and if Your wisdom should think so fitt to oblige my mastr. to put me into such a deicent Habbitt with the Allowance of Sum of money and restore my Indentiores that I may become Serviceable in some honest business in London or go to Sea and Your humble petitioner as in duty bound shall ever pray Etc
