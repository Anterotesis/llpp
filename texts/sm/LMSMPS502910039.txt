of some few of the said Inhabitants wherein Divine Worship hath ever since been performed, and an annual rent is now paid by the Petitioners for the same, And that great part of the said Church- together with the Tower thereof about five yeares since fell down, and nothing now remains standing but a small part of one of the walls thereof soe- that the said Church and Tower must unavoidably be rebuilt, And that the said parish of Ealing being very extensive and the Inhabitants thereof [---] very Numerous, there being about seven hundred Familys therein, and the Town of Old Brentford (which is cheifly inhabited by poor Watermen Fishermen and Day Labourers) being part of and lying within the said parish the petitioners are burthened with a very Numerous poor, for whose maintenance the annual Assessments have in some yeares amounted to three shillings in the pound, And that the Petitioners have lately erected a workhouse for which they are indebted a considerable sum, so that the petitioners are not able by any contributions make among themselves to raise a sum sufficient to rebuild the said Church, although they have used their utmost endeavours so to do by getting a subscription amongst themselves for that purpose, but such subscription in case the whole money subscribed should be paid which is very uncertain will amount to no more than the sum of five hundred and twenty pounds or thereabouts, And that the Petitioners

have employed divers able and experienced workmen who have carefully viewed the said Church as now in ruins, and made an estimate of the Charge of rebuilding the same, which upon a moderate computation amounts to the sum of three thousand pounds and upwards, And that the said Tabernacle in which the petitioners now assemble for Divine Worship [---] is a very slight Building and not likely to stand long, it being only designed when built for a short continuance and untill the said Church could be rebuilt, And Therefore the Petitioners by their said petition prayed that wee the said Justices would grant them a Certificate of the truth of the premisses to be represented to his Majesty in order for [---] the gaining his Royal Letters Patent for the [...] collecting the benevolence and charitable contributions of his loving subjects [---] in the most speedy and beneficial manner for carrying on so good and pious a work And Wee the said Justices of the peace doe Hereby accordingly Certify unto your Lordship That It appeareth unto us upon examination [---] into the truth of the premisses and by the Oaths of several credible persons sworn before us in open Court And by inspecting the parochial rates that great part of the said Parish Church of Ealing and the
