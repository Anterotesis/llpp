To the Worshipfull Bench of Justices now sitting at Hicks's Hall the Petition of Robt: Daniel most humbly

Sheweth That your Worships Petitioner was commited by this Worshipfull Bench to Clerkenwell Bridewell to hard Labour for cheating & defrauding the Honble: Henry Finch Esqr. of five Guineas, as alledged on Friday last, but by Reason of a Sore Leg which, he has and the other being rubbed and tore by the heavy Irons which they have put on him for want of Money he is quite uncapable of preforming the Labour your Worships order'd him. The truth of this can be attested by creditable Evidence Therefore most humbly hopes your Worships will order him some relief as Your Worshipfull Bench in your great Wisdoms shall think meet and he as in Duty bound shall ever pray

Robert Daniell
