The Humble Petition and Complaint of John Gee

Sheweth That on or about the fifty day of May 1789 Your Petitioner was bound an Apprentice to Deodatus Bye of the Parish of Saint John Clerkenwell Printer for the Term of Seven Years to learn the Art and Mystery of a Printer And that a Premium of Fifty pounds was paid with your Petitioner for that purpose and the said Deodatus Bye did by the Indenture of Apprenticeship thereupon Executed Covenant and Engage to teach and Instruct or Cause to be Taught and Instructed your Petitioner in such Act and to find Your Petitioner sufficient necessarys during such Apprenticeship as by the said Indenture which with the Counterpart thereof in now in this Possesion or Power of the said Deodatus Bye will when produced appear

That it is a Matter as your Petitioner Submitts generally known and as well Understood that the Art and Mystery of a Printer Consists first in the Composing and putting of Words by Types or Letters into a case or Form which is called "Case Work" and such case or Four is afterwards placed in a Press or Engine for the Impression of the same on Paper or other material of the like Nature and that the doing to this is called 'Press work' The first namely Case work being a Work of Art and can only be Acquired by means of great Instruction and Application. The last namely press Work being a Work of little or us Art but of great Drudgery and Labour and the knowledge of it may be attained with very little Instruction

Your Petitioners Friends namely the Father and Mother of your Petitioner are advised by persons of long Experience in the Trade of a Printer That your Petitioner without a Knowledge of Case Work [---] can never enter upon or set up the Printing Business with any Skill or Competency for the acquiring his Livelihood therein and that The Knowledge of Press work Confers no other Qualification on Your Petitioner that that of common Labourer or Drudge in a Printer Office

That though as will appear from the date of the said Indentures and Calculating to the present time the greater part of Your Petitioners Apprenticeship is run out Yet in all that time Your Petitioner sheweth and is ready to Prove the said Deodatus Bye hath with held instructing Your Petitioner Causing time to be Instructed at Case Work though repeated applied to for that purpose and Sollicited for such Instruction but the said Deodatus Bye hath always avoided and refused the same and during all that time hath only kept him unemployed at press.

That the said Deodatus Bye far from attending to the Sollicitations of Your Petitioner that he might be but to case Work and on the Contrary showing an intent and determination to persist in the Continuance of Your Petitioner at Press work [...] lately Order Your Petitioner to take upon him the Instruction of same other Apprentice whom the said Deodatus Bye was about to Engage to which Your Petitioner by the advice and direction of his said friends objected alledging that so fore from being able to Instruct another Your Petitioner was in want of Instruction himself at the same time submitting to the said Deodatus Bye the necessity to being put to Case Work as also

that it was his Duty and Interest as an Apprentice to receive Instruction but no part of that Duty to give it

That with a View to Terrify your Petitioner as he and his Friends are now well Convinced into an Acquiescence with the unjust Measurer of the said Deodatus Bye towards Your Petitioner in with holding from him the proper Instruction due to him as an Apprentice and to Compel him to a Continuance at press work and at such Work to Assist such Apprentice as the said Deodatus Bye proposed taking he the said Deodatus Bye contrived and put in Execution the following unjust plan and practices with respect to Your Petitioner, that is to say, Your Petitioner with other the Apprentices of the said Deodatus Bye and Henry Law partner with the said Deodatus Bye on the 25th. day November having as was frequent and unavoidable broker Holes in three or four Pieces of old and Spoiled parchment which attached to Printing presses are called Tympins the original Cost of which amount only to a few Pence and the Mending whereof is not attended with any Expence whatever It was signified to Your Petitioner from the said Deodatus Bye through the Medium of one of his Journeymen that he had sent for a Constable and that Your Petitioner was to be Apprehended on a charge which was the Same for which several Spittlefield weavers some Years ago had been Hung And that Your Petitioner and another Apprentice named "James Cook" would be timed for this Offence at the Old Baily and the best they were to expect was Transportation

That Your Petitioner though Unconscious of any offence yet being greatly Terrified at such Threats of being Apprehended and Tried precipitately left the said Deodatus

Byes House and went to his said Friends who immediately applying to the said Deodatus Bye he repeated to them the Threats he had before Communicated by his said Journeyman but Concluded that if Your Petitioner wod. returns would Continue at his Press work and Instruct such Apprentice that then the whole should be Cooked over

That Your Petitioners Friends being determined against the return of Your Petitioner on such Conditions as the said Deodatus Bye then endeavoured to Compel directed their Sollicitor to take the proper measures for obtaining relief or Your Petitioners discharge from the said Deodatus Bye when it appears that the said Deodatus Bye on the very day Your Petitioners said Friends so applied to him Caused the Scandalous Wicked and Malicious Hand Bill of and Concerned Your Petitioner marked (A) and hereunto annexed to be put to press and a proof Copy thereof being Communicated to the Said Sollicitor of Your Petitioners Friends the following Letter was immediately addressed and sent by him to the said Deodatus Bye Vizt.

"Messrs" Bye and Law Gentleman An Application "has made to me on the part of John Gee and James Cook "Apprentices to Mr. Bye in respect of some Disputes which I "am given to Understand at present Subsist between you and "them a Printed Hand Bill has been shewn me dated "from your Office containing a gross and Scandalous Libel on "their Conduct and Characters

"Untill an Appeal can be made to the law and "Justice of the County in regard to those Disputes and which "I am instructed and shall immediately do on there behalf "I do hereby give you Notice against the further Circulation of "such Hand Bill the same being wholly Unwarrented

"and instead of tending to the purpose of Justice a "gross Aggravation and offence to it I am Gentlemen

"Your Hble Sert. "Samuel Godfrey

"Fow Street "28th. Novr. 1793}

That the said Deodatus Bye through he hereupon Omitted as your Petitioner is informed the further Publication of such Scandalous hand Bill Yet to prosecute a Malicious intention towards Your Petitioner and in Contempt of those Laws which the said Sollicitor on the part of Your Petitioner gave him assurance he should Appeal to the said Deodatus Bye directly published another Hand Bill being the one hereunto annexed and marked (B)

That your Petitioner on the 3d. of this instant December having procured a Sums. requiring the appearance of the said Deodatus Bye before Cranley Thomas Kerby Esquire one of his Majesties Justices of the peace for the County the said Deodatus Bye thought personally applied to with such Summons with hold and Denied himself to the person having the Service thereof such person at that time not knowing the said Deodatus Bye but who afterwards meeting with the Wife of the said Deodatus Bye served the same on her and at the same time gave Notice for the same Deodatus Bye to produce Joseph Hitt and Henry Hayes who were Apprentices in his employ in order to their giving Evidence before the said Justice on several of the Allegations of Your Petitioner

That the said Deodatus Bye afterwards on appearg. to said Summons offered no Vindication whatever of himself for the conduct he had exercised towards your Petitioner in respect of the afore mentioned Threats and Hand Bills but principally endeavoured to Avail himself of the meant he possessed of preventing the said Joseph Hilt and Henry Hayes from Coming forward in support for several of Your Petitioner Allegations against him

by Pretending that were not his Apprentices the Fact indeed being that though were under his direction and Controul they were as to town apprenticed to Henry Law his said Partner but the said Magistrate on the Case as Stated on both sides after reprirnanding the said Deodatus Bye for his Conduct in respect of Your Petitioner and with holding him from a Proper Instruction recommended to him to Consent to Your Petitioners being discharged from his said Apprenticeship but the said Deodatus Bye refusing to Comply with such recommendation the said Magistrate ordered him to Enter into Proper recognizances to appear and abide the order and Determination of Your Petitioners appeal to the Sessions thereon.

Your Petitioner therefore most humbly Prays that he may be discharged from his said Apprenticeship and that the said Deodatus Bye may be Ordered to refund such part of the said Premium of Fifty Pounds so Paid with Your Petitioner as aforesaid as shall be decend Consistant with the Justices of your Petitioners Case

And Yours Petitioner will ever Pray Etc
