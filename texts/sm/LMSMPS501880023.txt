The humble Peticon of John Cook of St. Leonard Shoredith.

Sheweth That William Whip of the parish of Mirnhem in Nottinghamshire wth. his Wife and five Children came for a Lodging to your Petrs. house Produced a Certificate under the hands of 3 Justices of ye. Peace & Officers of sd Parish (wch your Petr. shewd. to yr. Churchwardens of sd St Leonards) That ye. said Whip & his Family belonged to the sd. parish of Mirchem, and yt. they Should be received back upon Occasion.

That Soon after the Sd. Whip & his Wife dyed and left the sd. 5 Children upon the hands of yor: Petr.

Upon wch. yor. Petr. made his case known to ye: Parish & had £3.10s. allowed, and Mr. Storey ye. Parish Soll exterted with threateing words a Note from yor. Petr. in Full, & Caused yor. Petr. to pay £1:4s for ye. Funeralls of sd. Whip and his Wife and by the delay of the Churchwarden & their Sollr. in getting a Pass warrant ye. sd. 5 Children remained chargeable to yor. Petr. for 6: Weeks at £2 P week now to £3

That your Petr. was compelled to goe with ye. Sd. Children into Nottinghamshire and provide 2 Nurses for the Children, and 2 horses to carry them, being 14 dayes out cost him £5.10s besides loss of time and paying the Nurses and Horse hire, and very great hardship yor.

Therefore yor.
