Sheweth

That John Andrews and Joseph Druce House holders and Inhabitants of the said parish who served the Office of Overseers of the Poor of the said parish for the year ending at or about Easter last did during the Continuance of their said Office by Virtue of two several rates made for the relief and Maintenance of the poor of the said parish and otherwise by Virtue of their said Office collect and receive divers large sums of Money for and towards the necessary relief and support of the poor of the said parish for which sums so collected and received they have delivered their Accounts

That in discharge of the monies so by them Collected and received they have charged and taken credit for in their said Accounts very large sums of Money which are stated and expressed therein to have been paid by them for various purposes that your petitioners conceive have no relation to the relief or support of the Poor nor can be legally chargeable on or paid out of the Monies collected by Virtue of the Poors rate To Wit the said John Andrews has charged and taken Credit as aforesaid for the sum of Fifty nine pounds four shillings and two pence purporting to be the Amount of the Bill of Messrs Acton and Winter Attornies at Law for fees and other charges incurring in opposing a Bill that was brought into parliament for shutting up a Road called love lane between Richmond Gardens and Kew Gardens in the County of Surry the Object whereof had no relation what ever to any of the purposes to which the said Ratcought by Law to be made collected or applied and has likewise Charged and taken credit as aforesaid for the sum of Twelve Pounds nine Shillings and three pence as paid by him the said John Andrews to the Constables and Headborough of the said parish without producing any legal order or Authority for the payment thereof as your petitioners apprehend and has likewise Charged and taken Credit as aforesaid for the sum of Three Pounds seventeen shillings and six pence stated in the Account of him the said John Andrews to be "Expences of the Jury on the Body of a new born Infant"And the said Joseph Druce has charged and taken credit as aforesaid for the sum of Seven pounds two shillings and eight pence as paid by him to the said Constables and Head borough without producing any legal Order or Authority for the payment thereof as your Petitioners apprehend all which said Charges your Petitioners conceive to be illegal.

That the said John Andrews and Joseph Druce have likewise charged and take credit in their said accounts for several other sums of Money, that is to say the said Joseph Druce the sum of two Pounds charged as paid by him on the 30th. of July 1788 "at the making a Poors Rate" and the further sum of One Pound one shilling charged as paid by him the 18th. of February 1789 "Upon making the second Poors Rate" and the said John Andrews the sum of One pound one shilling charged as paid by him on the last mentioned Day and likewise stated to be "Upon "making the second poors. Rate" the whole of the said three last mentioned sums amounting together to the sum of Four pounds two Shillings and as the Vestry Clerk of the said Parish has an annual Salary for executing the duties of his Office a part whereof is the Copying and Figuring the said Rate your Petitioners apprehend the said several Charges last mentioned are for Tavern Expences only and therefore improper and illegal

That the said John Andrews has also charged and taken credit as aforesaid for the sum of £11..14..6 as expences in attending the Sessions of this County on the Trial of an Appeal which said Sum does not as your Petitioners apprehend include any part of the Bill of the Solicitor who managed such Appeal nor any Fees paid to Counsel but appears to be only for travelling and tavern expences And has likewise charged and taken credit as aforesaid for the sum of £8..3..6 as the expences incurred in apprehending one Stephen Stockbridge upon a charge of Bastardy and procuring him to be Married and the sum of 10s/ as paid to one Joseph Andrews for attending at the Westminster Election

That the said John Andrews and Joseph Druce might have verified their Accounts before a Justice or Justices of the Peace in their own neighbourhood without any expence whatever notwithstanding which they went for he purpose of verifying the same from the said Parish to the Publick Office in Bow Street Covent Garden and each of them have charged and taken credit in their said Accounts for fourteen Shillings amounting in the whole to the sum of one Pound and eight Shillings as and for their expences on that occasion charges which under the abovementioned circumstances

Your Petitioners apprehend there was no necessity to incur and therefore the same appears to be unreasonable and illegal

That the said John Andrews and Joseph Druce have likewise charged and taken credit in their said Accounts for other very large sums of Money Vizt. the said John Andrews the sum of Thirty Pounds and upwards and the said Joseph Druce the sum of Fifty Pounds and upwards stated by them respectively to have been paid to Casual Poor without Producing any Order or Authority for such payments and a great number of the said last mentioned payments Vizt. Amounting to the sum of Eight Pounds fourteen shillings and four pence Charged by the said John Andrews and to the sum of Two pounds two shillings and six pence Charged by the said Joseph Druce are so charged without mentioning the names of the Persons for whose relief the same were applied And that besides the sums charged as paid to Casual Poor as aforesaid the said John Andrews and Joseph Druce as Overseers of the Poor aforesaid did during their Continuance in the said Office give a great number of Notes or Orders in Writing under their several hands to a Baker or Bakers and to a Butcher, or Butchers directing them respectively to Deliver to various Persons Quantities of Bread and Butchers Meat from time to time to a very considerable amount under pretence that the Persons to whom the same were to be Delivered were poor and stood in need of relief and that it was proper to relieve them in that manner And in consequence of such Notes or Orders having been given as aforesaid the Baker or Bakers Butcher or Butchers to whom the same were sent or directed charged in their several Bills (over and above their several Charges for such Bread and Butchers Meat as were sent by them respectively to the Workhouse of the said Parish for the subsistance of the Poor therein) very Considerable sums of Money the payment whereof the said John Andrews and Joseph Druce have severally taken Credit for in their said Accounts without producing any Order or Authority for having given such Notes or Orders as before mentioned or any of them or for the payment of the monies which are charged in their said Accounts as having been paid by them respectively in consequence of their having given the same All which said Payments to Casual Poor charged by them the said John Andrews and Joseph Druce severally and respectively as aforesaid and Notes or Orders for Bread and Butchers Meat given by them as aforesaid and the payments and Charges for payments in consequence thereof as aforesaid your Petitioners apprehend to be contrary to the express Declarations and true intent and meaning of the several statutes made for the Relief of the Poor and also to be of very Dangerous example as by the suffering of such unwarrantable practices the Inhabitants of the said parish may be subjected to great Edwds.

That a very inconsiderable increase has happened during Twelve Years last past either in the number of Poor maintained in the Workhouse of the said Parish or in the number of poor belonging to the said parish whose names and the Occasions which brought them under the necessity of receiving collection or relief have been registered according to Law notwithstanding which the Monies stated in the before mentioned Accounts to have been expended in the relief of the Poor of the said Parish during the said Year ending at or about Easter last amounted to nearly Double the sum that was annually expended in for or concerning the relief and maintenance of the Poor of the said Parish Twelve Years ago as by the Accounts of the said Parish it appears that the annual sum expended for the purposes aforesaid amounted in the year ending at Easter 1777 to seven hundred and thirty six pounds nine shillings and two pence and in the year ending at Easter last the expenditure amounted to One thousand Five hundred and seventy seven Pounds thirteen shillings and five pence which said extravagant increase is now become an intolerable grievance and burther to your Petitioners and many other Inhabitants of the said Parish

That your Petitioners apprehend the before mentioned increase in the Expences of relieving and maintaining the poor of the said parish has been principally occasioned by illegal Charges in the Accounts of the said John Andrews and Joseph Druce as Overseers of the Poor aforesaid many whereof are as before mentioned And that another Principal Cause of the said increase in expence has been Occasioned by the improper manner in which provisions Cloathing and Fuel for the Poor in the Workhouse of the said Parish have been purchased as by the several Prices of or charges for the same will appear And that the said John Andrews and Joseph Druce during the whole of the lastmentioned Year not only omitted and neglected to purchase the aforesaid Articles for the use of the poor in the said Workhouse at Fair Reasonable and proper prices but on the contrary purchased the same at very high rates and greatly above the Prices at which they might have been procured a practice in which in the Apprehension and belief of your Petitioners they were encouraged by a number of Inhabitants of the said Parish many of whom had the Advantage of serving the Workhouse with the above mentioned Articles at the aforesaid high rates and Prices and therefore not only attended themselves at the Monthly Makings to sign and

settle (as it was termed) Accounts of which their Bills Constituted a Part but procured the attendance of their Friends and of other Persons who were in expectation of providing and serving the like articles in what was Called their turns and who had in Contemplation an Interest in setting such Accounts however exhorbitant the Charges therein might be as they expected to have the same favour in return when their Bills came to be settled in like manner.

That illegal Charges in the Accounts of the Overseers of the Poor of the said Parish and the measures pursued in purchasing Articles for the necessary relief and maintenance of the Poor in the Work house of the said Parish as aforesaid have during several years last past been growing evils And there is every reason to suppose that if similar misconduct is not checked or prevented in future by the timely interposition of this Court the like practices will be continued and encreased to the most enormous extent and so as to prove highly grievous and detrimental to Your Petitioners and many other Inhabitants of the said Parish

Your Petitioners conceiving themselves aggrieved by the Acts and Conduct of the said John Andrews and Joseph Druce as Overseers of the Poor aforesaid and having many material Objections (some whereof are before mentioned) to their Accounts as such Overseers Therefore appeal to this Court against the same and pray Your Worships to appoint a Day in this present Session for the hearing and Determining the said Appeal And that such relief may be given to Your Petitioners in the premises as to your Worships shall seem just and reasonable

And your Petitioners shall ever pray Etc.
