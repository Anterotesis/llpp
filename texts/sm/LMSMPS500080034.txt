Sheweth That your petrs in the exccuon of their Said Office have used their utmost diligence in collecting all moneys rated upon the Inhabitants within their division for and towards the reliefe of the poor thereof and have from time to time duely applyed the same & have carefully endeavoured to prevent all unnecessary charge in their Said difrict by Inmates and otherwise

That yet by reason the Said poor are lately much increased and for that there is Sixty one pound of the present Rate in arreare (which or any part thereof. your petrs. cannot receive by reason of poverty & removalls of the defaulter therein) the present Rate is become farr short to answer the charge thereof That great part of the Ancient Inhabitant of the said division being sensible of the prmisses and of the great & pressing necessities of the said poor have for & towards their reliefe unanimously consented to have the rate doubled for Christmas quarter and to that end have caused such rate to be made in order to have your Worship confirmation thereof.

May it therefore please your Worshipps to confirme the said double Rate or to make Such Order in the premisses as your Wisdoms shall thinkefitt

And your petrs. shall ever pray Etc
