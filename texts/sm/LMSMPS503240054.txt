The humbled Petition of John Broomhall

Sheweth That in the year of our Lord 1732 your Petrs. was put as an Apprentice to John Dawson of the Parish of St. Leonard Shoreditch in the County of Middx and Phillicia his Wife And a Writing in the nature of an Indenture was made for that Purpose by which it is mentioned that your Petr. was to learn the act and Trade which the said John Dawson then used which was no other than the Art of a Ganger he being an Excise Man but his Wife followed the Business of a Staymaker wch. was the Trade your Petrs. intended to learn.

That your Petr. hath continued as an Apprentice for the Space of four years and upwards during which time he hath demeaned himself as a faithull Servant to his said Master and Mistress but hath learned very little of the Trade of Stay making his said Master knowing nothing of it and his Mistress very unskilful in the Business and your Petr. hath been very little Employed in the Trade but hath been chiefly employed in doing the Work of the house and going on Errands they keeping no Servant And more over hath been kept very Short of Victuals and been unmerci- -fully beaten by his sd. Master without any just Cause. The Marks of whose ill usage are still to be seen upon him.

That your Petr. hath causally lost that part of the said Writing-given by the Master and Mistress

May it therefore Please your Worships to Order the said Master to Attend your Worships with the Indenture or Writing and for the reasons aforesaid to discharge your Petr. of such his sd. Apprenticeship

And your Petr. Shall ever Pray Etc.
