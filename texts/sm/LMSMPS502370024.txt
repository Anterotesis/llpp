The Humble Peticon of Eliz: Megson

Sheweth That some time in May last Yor Peticoner was Bound over to answer the Complaint of Sr. Richd. Manningham Knt. for being a Disorderly Servant

That yor Peticoner appeared at the last Sessions in order to be discharged of her Recognizances But Upon Sr. Richards Suggesting to the Court that his witnesses were out of the way or that his Councel had not had time to Prepare an Indictment or for Some other Cause the Court was pleased to Indulge Sr. Richard So farr as to respile yor peticoners Recognizance till this Sessions.

That Yor peticoner was at great Expences incoming out of yorkshire (her native Countrey) to appear at the last Sessions to Save her Recognizance and hath Continued in Town greatest part of the time Since at great Expences, and by reason of such extra ordinary expences is Unable to be at the Charge of Councel to move for her discharge

Yor. Peticoner therefore humbly Prays yd worships that the may be discharged from the Said Recognizance unless Sr. Richd. Manningham Shall Shew good Cause upon oath to the Contrary and that in such Case Sr. Rich may Pay the Expence of Respiting Yor Peticoners Reconizace, and that if Your Worships Shall be pleased to Continue yor Peticoner till next Sessions there may be a Minute taken that ye Peticoner Shall be then discharged if no Prosecution against her
